 refers to two buildings that have existed at the same location within the in The original structure part of the was completed in 1987 and was destroyed in the in 2001 The current structure opened in May 2006 Both buildings were developed by who holds a for the site from the The original Trade Center was tall clad in red granite masonry and occupied a footprint An elevated walkway spanning connected the building to the World Trade Center plaza The building was situated above a power substation which imposed unique structural design constraints When the building opened in 1987 Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants signed a long term lease in 1988 and became the main tenant of On September 11 2001 the structure was substantially damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the The debris ignited fires on multiple lower floors of the building which continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the afternoon The building s internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires The collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered of nearby columns throughout which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at 5 20 33 pm This initiated of the entire building at according to while the 2008 NIST study placed the final collapse time at The collapse made the old 7 World Trade Center the first steel skyscraper known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires Construction of the new Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in 2006 The building is tall plus one underground floor making it the 28th tallest in New York It is built on a smaller footprint than the original and is bounded by Greenwich and Barclay Streets on the east south west and north respectively A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building s footprint The current building s design emphasizes safety with a core wider stairways and thicker fireproofing on steel columns It also incorporates numerous features The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U S Green Building Council s LEED certification where it won a gold rating It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the Council s pilot program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Core and Shell Development LEED CS The original 7 World Trade Center was a 47 story building designed by with a red facade The building was 610 feet 190 m tall with a footprint that was 330 ft 100 m long and 140 ft 43 m wide managed construction of the building The ground breaking ceremony was hosted on October 2 1984 The building opened in May 1987 becoming the seventh structure of the 7 World Trade Center was constructed above a two story that had been located on the site since 1967 The substation had a foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25 stories containing 600 000 sq ft 56 000 m The final design for 7 World Trade Center was for a much larger building than originally planned when the substation was built The structural design of 7 World Trade Center therefore included a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders located between floors 5 and 7 to transfer loads to the smaller foundation Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used along with new ones to accommodate the building The 5th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons Above the 7th floor the building s structure was a typical design with columns in the core and on the perimeter and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames A shipping and receiving ramp which served the entire World Trade Center complex occupied the eastern quarter of the 7 World Trade Center footprint The building was open below the 3rd floor providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp The spray on for structural steel elements was based which had a two hour fire rating for steel beams girders and trusses and a three hour rating for columns Mechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven including 12 on the 5th floor Several installed in the building were used by the and other tenants In order to supply the generators 24 000 gallons 91 000 L of were stored below ground level Diesel fuel distribution components were located at ground level up to the ninth floor After the of February 26 1993 New York City mayor decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7 World Trade Center Although this decision was criticized in light of the events of the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building The roof of the building included a small west penthouse and a larger east mechanical penthouse Each floor had 47 000 sq ft 4 400 m of rentable office space which made the building s floor plans considerably larger than most office buildings in the City In all 7 World Trade Center had 1 868 000 sq ft 173 500 m of office space Two pedestrian bridges connected the main World Trade Center complex across Vesey Street to the third floor of 7 World Trade Center The lobby of 7 World Trade Center held three murals by artist and In June 1986 before construction was completed developer signed as a tenant to lease the entire 7 World Trade Center building for 3 billion over a term of 30 years In December 1986 after the scandal Drexel Burnham Lambert canceled the lease leaving Silverstein to find other tenants Spicer Oppenheim agreed to lease 14 percent of the space but for more than a year as and other factors adversely affected the real estate market Silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space By April 1988 he had lowered the rent and made other concessions In November 1988 withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at in and agreed to a 20 year lease for the top 19 floors of 7 World Trade Center The building was extensively renovated in 1989 to accommodate the needs of Salomon Brothers This led to the alternative naming of the building as the Salomon Brothers building Most of the three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other floors and more than 350 tons U S of steel were added to construct three double height trading floors Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station Essentially Salomon is constructing a building within a building and it s an occupied building which complicates the situation said a district manager of The unusual task was possible said Larry Silverstein because it was designed to allow for entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building s structural integrity on the assumption that someone might need double height floors At the time of the September 11 2001 attacks Salomon Smith Barney was by far the largest tenant in 7 World Trade Center occupying 1 202 900 sq ft 111 750 m 64 percent of the building which included floors 28 45 Other major tenants included 122 590 sq ft 11 400 m Bank International 106 117 sq ft 9 900 m 111 398 sq ft 10 350 m and the 106 117 sq ft 9 850 m Smaller tenants included the Regional Council 90 430 sq ft 8 400 m and the 85 343 sq ft 7 900 m The smallest tenants included the of New York First State Management Group Inc and the The DOD and CIA shared the 25th floor with the IRS The clandestine CIA office was revealed only after the 9 11 attacks Floors 46 47 were mechanical floors as were the bottom six floors and part of the seventh floor As the North Tower collapsed on September 11 2001 heavy debris hit 7 World Trade Center damaging the south face of the building and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon The collapse also caused damage to the southwest corner between floors 7 and 17 and on the south face between Floor 44 and the roof other possible structural damage included a large vertical gash near the center of the south face between Floors 24 and 41 The building was equipped with a but had many single point vulnerabilities for failure the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps rather than being a fully automatic system the floor level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser and the sprinkler system required some power for the to deliver water Additionally water pressure was low with little or no water to feed sprinklers After the North Tower collapsed some firefighters entered 7 World Trade Center to search the building They attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire but low water pressure hindered their efforts Over the course of the day fires burned out of control on several floors of 7 World Trade Center the flames visible on the east side of the building During the afternoon the fire was also seen on floors 6 10 13 14 19 22 and 29 30 In particular the fires on floors 7 through 9 and 11 through 13 continued to burn out of control during the afternoon At approximately 2 00 pm firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7 World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse During the afternoon firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building Around 3 30 pm FDNY Chief decided to halt rescue operations surface removal and searches along the surface of the debris near 7 World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel The fire expanded the girders of the building causing some to lose their structural integrity This led column number 79 a critical column supporting a large part of the 13th floor to buckle causing the floors above it to collapse to the fifth floor however this could not be seen from outside the building The structure also developed cracks in the facade just before the entire building started to fall According to FEMA this collapse started at 5 20 33 pm EDT when the east mechanical penthouse started crumbling Differing times are given as to what time the building completely collapsed at 5 21 10 pm EDT according to FEMA and at 5 20 52 pm EDT according to NIST There were no associated with the collapse NIST found no evidence to support such as the collapse being the result of explosives it found that a combination of factors including physical damage fire and the building s unusual construction set off a chain reaction collapse In May 2002 the FEMA issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the under the leadership of Dr P E FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued burning unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation Subsequently the NIST to lead an investigation into the structural failure and Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center The investigation led by Dr S Shyam Sunder drew upon in house technical expertise as well as the knowledge of several outside private institutions including the Structural Engineering Institute of the SEI ASCE the SFPE the NFPA the American Institute of Steel Construction AISC the CTBUH and the SEAoNY The bulk of the investigation of 7 World Trade Center was delayed until after reports were completed on the Twin Towers In the meantime NIST provided a preliminary report about 7 WTC in June 2004 and thereafter released occasional updates on the investigation According to NIST the investigation of 7 World Trade Center was delayed for a number of reasons including that NIST staff who had been working on 7 World Trade Center were assigned full time from June 2004 to September 2005 to work on the investigation of the collapse of the Twin Towers In June 2007 Shyam Sunder explained In November 2008 NIST released its final report on the causes of the collapse of 7 World Trade Center This followed NIST s August 21 2008 draft report which included a period for public comments and was followed in 2012 by a peer reviewed summary in the In its investigation NIST utilized to model events leading up to collapse initiation and models to simulate the global response to the initiating events NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers or the transfer elements trusses girders and cantilever overhangs The lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor The fires burned out of control during the afternoon causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14 With a loss of lateral support across nine floors column 79 buckled pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it With the buckling of these critical columns the collapse then progressed east to west across the core ultimately overloading the perimeter support which buckled between Floors 7 and 17 causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall down as a single unit The fires which were fueled by office contents and burned for 7 hours along with the lack of water were the key reasons for the collapse Incidentally this made the old 7 WTC the only steel skyscraper at the time to have collapsed from fire When 7 WTC collapsed debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the s building located adjacent at 30 West Broadway to the extent that the building was not salvageable A revised plan called for demolition in 2009 and completion of the new Fiterman Hall in 2012 at a cost of 325 million The an building located directly to the west had extensive damage to its eastern facade from the collapse of 7 World Trade Center though it was later restored at a cost of US 1 4 billion Files relating to numerous federal investigations had been housed in 7 World Trade Center The estimated over 10 000 of its cases were affected Investigative files in the Secret Service s largest field office were lost with one Secret Service agent saying All the evidence that we stored at 7 World Trade in all our cases went down with the building Copies of emails in connection with the scandal that were later requested by the from a subsidiary of housed in the building were also destroyed The NIST report found no evidence supporting the conspiracy theories that 7 World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition Specifically the window breakage pattern and blast sounds that would have resulted from the use of explosives were not observed The suggestion that an incendiary material such as was used instead of explosives was considered unlikely by NIST because of the building s structural response to the fire the nature of the fire and the unlikelihood that a sufficient amount of thermite could be planted without discovery Based on its investigation NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the Twin Towers It urged immediate action on a further recommendation that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse the main point of NIST s recommendations was that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable The new 7 World Trade Center has 52 stories and is 741 ft 226 m tall The building has 42 floors of leasable space starting at the 11th floor and a total of 1 700 000 sq ft 160 000 m of office space The first ten floors house an electrical substation which provides power to much of Lower Manhattan The office tower has a narrower footprint at ground level than did its predecessor so the course of Greenwich Street could be restored to reunite and the The original building on the other hand had bordered West Broadway on the east necessitating the destruction of Greenwich Street between Barclay Street and the northern border of the World Trade Center superblock of worked in conjunction with glass artist and designer James Carpenter to create a design that uses ultra clear low iron glass to provide reflectivity and light with stainless steel behind the glass to help reflect sunlight Stainless steel used in the building façade is containing Type 316 which provides improved resistance to corrosion To enclose the power substation and improve its aesthetics the base of the building has a curtain wall with that provide ventilation for the machinery During the day the curtain wall reflects light while at night it is illuminated with blue lights The curtain wall around the lobby uses heavily laminated heat strengthened glass that meets high standards for blast resistance At night a large cube of light above the lobby also emanates blue light while during the day it provides white light to the lobby and at dusk it transitions to violet and back to blue Inside the main lobby artist created a large light installation with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels The entire wall which is 65 ft 20 m wide and 14 ft 4 3 m tall changes color according to the time of day Holzer worked with Klara Silverstein the wife of Larry Silverstein to select poetry for the art installation The wall is structurally fortified as a security measure The building is being promoted as the safest skyscraper in the U S According to Silverstein Properties the owner of the building it incorporate s a host of life safety enhancements that will become the prototype for new high rise construction The building has 2 foot thick 0 61 m and elevator and stairway access shafts The original building used only to line these shafts The stairways are wider than in the original building to permit faster egress 7 World Trade Center is equipped with After pressing a destination floor number on a lobby keypad passengers are grouped and directed to specific elevators that will stop at the selected floor there are no buttons to press inside the elevators This system is designed to reduce elevator waiting and travel times The elevator system is integrated with the lobby turnstile and card reader system that identifies the floor on which a person works as he or she enters and can automatically call the elevator for that floor Nearly 30 percent of structural steel used in the building consists of recycled steel Rainwater is collected and used for irrigation of the park and to cool the building Along with other sustainable design features the building is designed to allow in plenty of natural light power is metered to tenants to encourage them to conserve energy the heating steam is reused to generate some power for the building and recycled materials are used for insulation and interior materials The construction phase of the new 7 World Trade Center began on May 7 2002 with the installation of a fence around the construction site Tishman Construction Corporation of New York began work at the new 7 World Trade Center in 2002 soon after the site was cleared of debris Restoring the Con Ed was an urgent priority to meet power demands of Lower Manhattan Because 7 World Trade Center is separate from the main 16 acre 6 5 ha required approval from only the and rebuilding was able to proceed quickly Building Seven was not included in the original World Trade Center master plan by but was designed by under the leadership of who largely redesigned Once construction of the power substation was completed in October 2003 work proceeded on building the office tower An unusual approach was used in constructing the building erecting the steel frame before adding the concrete core This approach allowed the construction schedule to be shortened by a few months Construction was completed in 2006 at a cost of 700 million Though Silverstein received 861 million from insurance on the old building he owed more than 400 million on its mortgage Costs to rebuild were covered by 475 million in which provide tax exempt financing to help stimulate rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and insurance money that remained after other expenses A 15 000 sq ft 1 400 m triangular park was created between the extended Greenwich Street and West Broadway by David Childs with Ken Smith and his colleague Annie Weinmayr of Ken Smith Landscape Architect The park comprises an open central plaza with a fountain and flanking groves of trees and shrubs At the center of the fountain sculptor created whose mirror polished stainless steel represents a twisted balloon in the shape of a flower The building was officially opened at noon on May 23 2006 with a free concert featuring Bill Ware Vibes of the and special guest Prior to opening in March 2006 the new 7 World Trade Center frontage and lobby were used in scenes for the movie with and Since the building opened several unleased upper floors have been used for events such as charity lunches fashion shows and black tie galas Silverstein Properties allowed space in the new building to be used for these events as a means to draw people to see the building From September 8 to October 7 2006 the work of photographer Jonathan Hyman was displayed in An American Landscape a free exhibit hosted by the at 7 World Trade Center The photographs captured the response of people in New York City and across the United States after the September 11 2001 attacks The exhibit took place on the 45th floor while space remained available for lease By March 2007 60 percent of the building had been leased In September 2006 signed a 20 year lease to rent 15 floors of 7 World Trade Center Other tenants that had signed leases in 7 World Trade Center as of May 2007 included Inc law firm Darby Darby P C Mansueto Ventures LLC business publisher of and and the The space occupied by has been designed to use the maximum amount of natural light and has an open floor plan The space used by the New York Academy of Sciences on the 40th floor designed by H Hardy Collaboration Architecture works with the shape of the building Keeping with the green design of the building the NYAS uses recycled materials in many of the office furnishings has zoned heating and cooling and lights which activate automatically when people are present and adjust according to incoming sunlight also has offices and the Silver Suites executive office suites in 7 World Trade Center along with office space used by the architectural and engineering firms working on and The building became fully leased in September 2011 when was reported to have leased a 125 000 square feet 11 600 m space on the top floor 
 The Dublin Trinity College Library MS A I 58 sometimes known as the is an in containing the of the together with various prefatory texts and tables It was created in a monastery in either or and may have had contributions from various Columban institutions from both Britain and Ireland It is believed to have been created 800 AD The text of the Gospels is largely drawn from the although it also includes several passages drawn from the earlier versions of the Bible known as the It is a masterwork of and represents the pinnacle of It is also widely regarded as one of Ireland s finest The manuscript takes its name from the which was its home for centuries The illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that of other Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art Figures of humans animals and mythical beasts together with and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours enliven the manuscript s pages Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations The manuscript today comprises 340 or the of each leaf total 680 Since 1953 it has been bound in four volumes The leaves are high quality calf the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated and interlinear miniatures marking the furthest extension of the anti classical and energetic qualities of Insular art The script of the text appears to be the work of at least three different scribes The lettering is in and the colours used were derived from a wide range of substances some of which were imported from distant lands Today it is housed at which usually has on display at any given time two of the current four volumes one showing a major illustration and the other showing typical text pages A digitised version of the entire manuscript may also be seen online The Book of Kells is one of the finest and most famous and also one of the latest of a group of manuscripts in what is known as the produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in in Ireland Scotland and England and in continental monasteries with or foundations These manuscripts include the the in the all from the early 7th century and the from the second half of the 7th century From the early 8th century come the the the see illustration at right and the Among others the belongs to the late 8th century and the dated to 807 809 to the early 9th century Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style script and textual traditions The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series either from the late 8th or early 9th century The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts For example the form of the decorated letters found in the pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels Compare for example the incipit pages of the and both of which feature intricate decorative knot work patterns inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text For a more complete list of related manuscripts see The Abbey of Kells in had been founded or refounded from construction taking from 807 until the consecration of the church in 814 The manuscript s date and place of production have been the subject of considerable debate Traditionally the book was thought to have been created in the time of possibly even as the work of his own hands This tradition has long been discredited on and stylistic grounds most evidence points to a composition date 800 long after St Columba s death in 597 The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with on Iona which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their into Ireland and Scotland There is another tradition with some traction among Irish scholars that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint s death Alternatively as is thought possible for the Northumbrian and also the both with it may have been produced to mark the translation or moving of Columba s remains into a shrine reliquary which probably had taken place by the 750s There are at least five competing theories about the manuscript s place of origin and time of completion First the book or perhaps just the text may have been created at Iona and then completed in Kells Second the book may have been produced entirely at Iona Third the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the at Kells Fourth it may have been produced in the north of England perhaps at then brought to Iona and from there to Kells Finally it may have been the product of or another monastery in Scotland though there is no actual evidence for this theory especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland Although the question of the exact location of the book s production will probably never be answered conclusively the first theory that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells is widely accepted Regardless of which theory is true it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona Kells Abbey was plundered and pillaged by Vikings many times in the beginning of the 9th century and how the book survived is not known The earliest historical reference to the book and indeed to the book s presence at Kells can be found in a 1007 entry in the This entry records that the great Gospel of Columkille Columba the chief relic of the Western World was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at Cenannas on account of its wrought shrine The manuscript was recovered a few months later minus its golden and bejewelled cover under a It is generally assumed that the great Gospel of Columkille is the Book of Kells If this is correct then the book was in Kells by 1007 and had been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells The description in the Annals of the book as of Columkille that is having belonged to and perhaps being made by Columba suggests that the book was believed at that time to have been made on Iona Regardless the book was certainly at Kells in the 12th century when land charters pertaining to the Abbey of Kells were copied onto some of its blank pages The practice of copying of charters into important books was widespread in the medieval period and such inscriptions in the Book of Kells provide concrete evidence about its location at the time The Abbey of Kells was dissolved because of the ecclesiastical reforms of the 12th century The abbey church was converted to a parish church in which the Book of Kells remained The 12th century writer in his described seeing a great Gospel Book in which many have since assumed was the Book of Kells The description certainly matches Kells Since Gerald claims to have seen this book in Kildare he may have seen another now lost book equal in quality to the Book of Kells or he may have misstated his location The Book of Kells remained in Kells until 1654 In that year s cavalry was quartered in the church at Kells and the governor of the town sent the book to for safekeeping who later became after the presented the manuscript to in Dublin in 1661 and it has remained there ever since except for brief loans to other libraries and museums It has been on display to the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century Over the years the Book of Kells received several additions to its text In the 16th century one Gerald Plunkett of Dublin added a series of numbering the chapters of the Gospels according to the division created by 13th century The prominent Anglican clergyman counted and numbered its folios in 1621 shortly after named him The manuscript s rise to worldwide fame began in the 19th century The association with St Columba who died the same year brought Christianity and literacy to Canterbury from Rome was used to demonstrate Ireland s cultural primacy seemingly providing irrefutable precedence in the debate on the relative authority of the Irish and Roman churches and were invited to sign the book in 1849 The book s artistry was influential on the several Victorian picture books of medieval illuminations featured designs from the book which were in turn extensively copied and adapted patterns appearing in metalwork embroidery furniture and pottery among other crafts Over the centuries the book has been several times During a 19th century rebinding the pages were badly cropped with small parts of some illustrations being lost The book was also rebound in 1895 but that rebinding broke down quickly By the late 1920s several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume In 1953 bookbinder rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity one opened at a major decorated page and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations In 2000 the volume containing the was sent to Australia for an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts This was only the fourth time the Book of Kells had been sent abroad for exhibition The volume suffered what has been called minor pigment damage while en route to Canberra It is thought that the vibrations from the aeroplane s engines during the long flight may have caused the damage The Book of Kells contains the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black red purple and yellow ink in an script preceded by prefaces summaries and concordances of Gospel passages Today it consists of 340 leaves or folios totaling 680 pages Almost all folios are numbered at recto bottom left One folio number 36 was mistakenly double counted As a result the of the entire book is reckoned thus folio 1r 36v 36 r 36 v the double counted folio and 37r 339v The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets called which are folded in half to form two folios The bifolios are nested inside of each other and sewn together to form gatherings called On occasion a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires There are between four and twelve folios two to six bifolios per quire the folios are commonly but not invariably bound in groups of ten Some folios are single sheets as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages The folios had lines drawn for the text sometimes on both sides after the bifolios were folded Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages The vellum is of high quality although the folios have an uneven thickness with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent The book s current dimensions are 330 by 250 mm Originally the folios were of no standard size but they were cropped to the current size during a 19th century rebinding The text area is approximately 250 by 170 mm Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its age though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing The book must have been the product of a major scriptorium over several years yet was apparently never finished the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621 but several leaves had already been lost by then The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations The extant book contains preliminary matter the complete text of the Gospels of and and the through John 17 13 The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of names contained in the Gospels Gospel summaries short biographies of the Evangelists and It is probable that like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh part of the lost preliminary material included the beginning in which explains the purpose of his translation It is also possible though less likely that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus in which he explains the use of the canon tables Of all the insular Gospels only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26 which is currently inserted at the end of the prefatory matter for John The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios The second list fragment on folio 26 contains about a fourth of the list for Luke The list for Luke would require an additional three folios The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27 so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John The first list fragment is followed by the canon tables of of These tables which predate the text of the Vulgate were developed to cross reference the Gospels Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most medieval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels The tables in the Book of Kells however are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables in such a way as to make them confused In addition the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer The reason for the omission remains unclear the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript s completion or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages The and belong to a pre Vulgate tradition of manuscripts The are summaries of the of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters These chapter numbers like the numbers for the canon tables are not used on the text pages of the Gospels It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used even if the manuscript had been completed because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text The are collections of legends about the Evangelists The and are arranged in a strange order first come the and for Matthew followed by the and for Mark then quite oddly come the of both Luke and John followed by their This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow although in the latter instance the misplaced sections appear at the very end of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary In other insular manuscripts such as the the and the each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the and found in Durrow led scholar to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand The Book of Kells contains the text of the four Gospels based on the It does not however contain a pure copy of the Vulgate There are numerous differences from the Vulgate where translations are used in lieu of Jerome s text Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of letters usually or The text is usually written in one long line across the page identified at least three scribes in this manuscript whom she named Hand A Hand B and Hand C Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v folios 276 through 289 and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript Hand A for the most part writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown common throughout the West Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128 Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A Hand C uses the same brownish gall ink used by hand A and wrote almost always seventeen lines per page There are several between the text and the accepted Gospels In the which starts at Luke 3 23 Kells names an extra ancestor At a common English translation reads I came not to send peace but a sword However the manuscript reads joy where it should read sword thus translating as I came not only to send peace but joy The lavishly decorated opening page of the Gospel according to John had been deciphered by George Bain as In principio erat verbum verum In the beginning was the True Word Therefore the incipit is a free translation into Latin of the original rather than a mere copy of the Roman version The text is accompanied by many full page while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities The decoration of the book is famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions The characteristics of the insular manuscript initial as described by Carl Nordenfalk here reach their most extreme realisation the initials are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs The illustrations feature a broad range of colours with purple lilac red pink green and yellow being the colours most often used Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes the Book of Durrow for example uses only four colours As is usual with insular work there was no use of or in the manuscript The for the illustrations included red and yellow ochre green copper pigment sometimes called indigo and possibly These would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and in the case of the lapis lazuli also known as from northeast Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript recent examination of the pigments has shown that lapis lazuli was not used The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving Insular Gospel book There are ten surviving full page illuminations including two three pages with the four a a miniature of the a miniature of Christ enthroned and miniatures of the and the There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the Gospels Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost In addition to these major pages there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text in fact only two pages have no decoration The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names This fragment occupies the left hand column of folio 1r A miniature of the four evangelist symbols now much abraded make up the right hand column The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels unity of message The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages In the Book of Kells the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages folios 1v through 7r but for unknown reasons condensed them into ten leaving folios 6v and 7r blank This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an as seen in the The Kells manuscript presents this in an Insular spirit where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches The last two canon tables are presented within a grid This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow The remainder of the book is broken into sections with the divisions set off by miniatures and full pages of decorated text Each of the Gospels is introduced by a consistent decorative programme The preliminary matter is treated as one section and introduced by a lavish decorative spread In addition to the preliminaries and the Gospels the second beginning of the Gospel of Matthew is also given its own introductory decoration The preliminary matter is introduced by an image of the folio 7v This miniature is the first representation of the in a Western manuscript Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three quarter pose This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of of 698 The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon The miniature of the Virgin and Child faces the first page of text and is an appropriate preface to the beginning of the of Matthew which begins the birth of Christ in Bethlehem The beginning page of the text of the is decorated and contained within an elaborate frame The two page spread of the miniature and the text makes a vivid introductory statement for the prefatory material The opening line of each of the sections of the preliminary matter is enlarged and decorated see above for the of Luke but no other section of the preliminaries is given the same level of treatment as the beginning of the of Matthew The book was designed so that each of the Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols followed by a blank page Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the Gospel which was given an elaborate decorative treatment The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait and its page of Evangelist symbols folio 27r see above The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page The Gospel of John like the Gospel of Matthew retains both its portrait folio 291v see at right and its Evangelist symbols page It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed but have been lost The use of all four of the Evangelist symbols in front of each Gospel is striking and was intended to reinforce the message of the unity of the Gospels The ornamentation of the opening few words of each Gospel is lavish their decoration is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible The opening page folio 29r of Matthew may stand as an example See illustration at left The page consists of only two words The book of the generation The of is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page The of is presented as an interlaced ornament within the of the monogram is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border The border and the letters themselves are further decorated with elaborate spirals and many of them zoomorphic The opening words of Mark The beginning of the Gospel Luke and John In the beginning was the Word are all given similar treatments Although the decoration of these pages was most extensive in the Book of Kells these pages were decorated in all the other Insular Gospel Books The Gospel of Matthew begins with a At the actual narrative of This second beginning to Matthew was given emphasis in many early Gospel Books so much so that the two sections were often treated as separate works The second beginning starts with the word The Greek letters and were normally used in medieval manuscripts to abbreviate the word In Insular Gospel Books the initial monogram was enlarged and decorated In the Book of Kells this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to those that preface the individual Gospels Folio 32 verso has a miniature of Christ enthroned It has been argued that this miniature is one of the lost evangelist portraits However the iconography is quite different from the extant portraits and current scholarship accepts this identification and placement for this miniature Facing this miniature on is the only carpet page in the Book of Kells which is rather anomalous the have five extant carpet pages and the has six The blank verso of folio 33 faces the single most lavish miniature of the early medieval period the Book of Kells Chi Rho monogram which serves as incipit for the narrative of the life of Christ In the Book of Kells the Chi Rho monogram has grown to consume the entire page The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across the majority of the page The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the The Book of Kells contains two other full page miniatures which illustrate episodes from the story The text of Matthew is illustrated with a full page illumination of the Jesus is shown beneath a stylised arcade while being held by two much smaller figures In the text of Luke there is a full sized miniature of the Christ is shown from the waist up on top of the Temple To his right is a crowd of people perhaps representing his disciples To his left and below him is a black figure of Above him hover two angels The verso of the folio containing the has a full page of decorated text which begins Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page of decorated text folio 203r Iesus autem plenus In addition to this page five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment In Matthew there is one other full page treatment Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones In the Gospel of Mark there are also two pages of decorated text Erat autem hora tercia and folio 187v Et Dominus quidem Iesus postquam The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text folio 188v Fuit in diebus Herodis and Una autem sabbati valde Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed In the Gospel of John there is no surviving full page of decorated text apart from its incipit However in the other three Gospels all the full pages of decorated text except for folio 188c which begins the Nativity narration occur within the Passion narrative However since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost The decoration of the book is not limited to the major pages Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots Many significant texts such as the have decorated initials The page containing text of the in Matthew has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke contains a similar miniature in which the word is repeatedly linked along the left margin Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a turn in the path that is a place where a line is finished in a space above or below the original line Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines No two of these designs are the same No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration The decorations are all high quality and often highly complex In one decoration which occupies a one inch square piece of a page there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses although lenses of the required power are not known to have been available until hundreds of years after the book s completion The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period The book had a sacramental rather than educational purpose Such a large lavish Gospel would have been left on the high altar of the church and removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text It is significant that the state the book was stolen from the where the vessels and other accoutrements of the were stored rather than from the monastic library Its design seems to take this purpose in mind that is the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page In general nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page aesthetics were given priority over utility Some of the first faithful reproductions made of pages and elements of the Book of Kells were by the artist in the 19th century She used vellum and reproduced the pigments used in the original manuscript Photographs of her drawings were included in Sullivan s study of the Book of Kells first printed in 1913 In 1951 the Swiss publisher Urs Graf Verlag Bern produced the first of the Book of Kells The majority of the pages were reproduced in black and white photographs but the edition also featured forty eight colour reproductions including all the full page decorations Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin produced a partial facsimile edition in 1974 which included a scholarly treatment of the work by Françoise Henry This edition included all the full page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages together with some enlarged details of the illustrations The reproductions were all in full colour with photography by John Kennedy Green Studio Dublin In 1979 Swiss publisher Faksimile Verlag Luzern requested permission to produce a full colour facsimile of the book Permission was initially denied because Trinity College officials felt that the risk of damage to the book was too high By 1986 Faksimile Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile After each page was photographed a single page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary The completed work was published in 1990 in a two volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells on the site of the original monastery Mario Kleff reproduced folios from the Book of Kells and together with Faksimile Verlag Publisher Urs Düggelin curated an exhibition of the Book of Kells which included these facsimile pages They were created using the original techniques and were also presented in the Diocesan Museum of Trier The ill fated heritage centre which opened in in 1992 included a replica of the Book of Kells It cost approximately 18 000 to produce In 1994 Bernard Meehan Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin produced an introductory booklet on the Book of Kells with 110 colour images of the manuscript His 2012 book contained more than 80 pages from the manuscript reproduced full size and in full colour A digital copy of the manuscript was produced by Trinity College in 2006 and made available for purchase through Trinity College on DVD Rom It included the ability to leaf through each page view two pages at a time or look at a single page in a magnified setting There were also commentary tracks about the specific pages as well as the history of the book Users were given the option to search by specific illuminated categories including animals capitols and angels It retailed for approximately 30 but has since been discontinued The Faksimile Verlag images are now online at Trinity College s The 2009 animated film tells a fictional story of the creation of the Book of Kells by an elderly monk Aidan and his young apprentice Brendan who struggle to work on the manuscript in the face of destructive Viking raids It was directed by and nominated for the in 2009 
 was a near in England It was surrounded by a 2 8 metre wide 9 ft stone and a ditch 10 metres 33 ft wide by 6 metres 20 ft deep Buckton is one of the earliest stone castles in North West England and only survives as buried remains overgrown with heather and peat It was most likely built and demolished in the 12th century The earliest surviving record of the site dates from 1360 by which time it was lying derelict The few finds retrieved during archaeological investigations indicate that Buckton Castle may not have been completed In the 16th century the site may have been used as a beacon for the During the 18th century the castle was of interest to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver had been discovered at Buckton The site was used as an anti aircraft decoy site during the Second World War Between 1996 and 2010 Buckton Castle was investigated by archaeologists as part of the Tameside Archaeology Survey first by the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford s Centre for Applied Archaeology The project involved and more than 60 volunteers took part The castle close to the Buckton Vale Quarry is a Buckton Castle lies 335 metres 1 099 ft above sea level on Buckton Hill a steep ridge To the south and west are the valleys of the Carr Brook and respectively Buckton Vale Quarry is close to the east of the castle while the town of is about four kilometres 2 mi south west of the site To the north and north east of the castle are areas of moorland with heather and peat The site may have been chosen to allow the castle s garrison to guard the Tame Valley During the Middle Ages Buckton Castle was at the eastern end of Cheshire The county shares its western border with Wales Both the castle and valley were in the medieval of A manor was a division of land administered by a or his representative in Tintwistle s case it was part of the larger lordship of Compared to and which were also on the Anglo Welsh border Cheshire has far fewer castles per square kilometre Most of the county s castles are close to the western border where the historically richer parts of Cheshire are concentrated The county is mostly lowland and is the only other castle in the area that rises as prominently above the surrounding landscape According to the archaeologist Rachel Swallow in the area which include Buckton Beeston and are predominantly a symbol of significant offensive and elite personal power in these landscapes The earliest castles in England typically were constructed from timber at least when they were first built as building in stone was more expensive evidence shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries the area where Buckton Castle would later be built was cleared of woodland This left little timber and may partly explain why stone was used as a building material It became more common to use stone in 12th century castles and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England Buckton Castle was probably built in the 12th century and there are three identifiable periods of medieval activity at the site the initial construction phase in which the ditch was dug and the curtain wall and gatehouse built the re cutting of the ditch and further building work behind the curtain wall and finally deliberate demolition Little datable material has been recovered from the site four of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly date to the late 12th century As is the case with many castles especially of the 12th century there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle Based on comparison to in Derbyshire where construction of the in 1175 1177 cost 184 according to the it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around 100 This was close to the annual income for a in 1200 Partly because of the cost and partly because Cheshire was a in which the earl had authority over who was permitted to build castles it is likely that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester Compared to other English counties along the Anglo Welsh border Cheshire has fewer castles per square kilometre indicating that the earl may have limited castle building The construction of the castle may have been prompted by the earls involvement in a civil war during reign in the middle of the 12th century or the against During the Anarchy David I of Scotland gained control of most of northern England including the parts of Lancashire prompting the construction of Buckton Castle to serve as a safeguard for Cheshire After the Anarchy many castles were slighted to restore England to its state before the conflict which may explain why Buckton was demolished Alternatively it could have been slighted after the Revolt of 1173 74 to punish the earl of Chester for taking part in a war against the king While it is likely the earls of Chester built the castle it is possible it could have been built by when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl between 1181 and 1186 though he may not have had the financial means to do so The dearth of artefacts recovered from Buckton Castle and the lack of finely finished stonework indicate that the site was never finished but the re cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy or abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications An estate survey from 1360 recorded that there is one ruined castle called Buckeden and of no value this is the earliest surviving reference to the castle At the time the lordship of Longdendale was the property of and the castle was derelict The site of the castle may have been used as a beacon in the 16th century first during the of 1536 37 and later in the 1580s when the country was under threat of invasion from Spain particularly with the in 1588 This usage may have been reprised in 1803 when a beacon hut is recorded near a settlement less than a mile west of the castle In the 18th century people began at Buckton Castle While the hunting was largely unsuccessful in 1767 one such venture discovered a gold necklace and a silver vessel though these artefacts have since been lost This prompted the interest of local several of whom visited in the 18th and 19th centuries often drawing plans of the castle Since 1924 the castle has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument which is intended to protect important archaeological sites from change this was probably to protect the castle from Buckton Vale Quarry as it expanded During the Second World War were built as decoys for bombing raids Nine were built around Manchester including one close to Buckton Castle At this time a brick hut was built over part of the castle ditch The Starfish site went out of use in 1943 In the 20th century it was suggested that Buckton Castle may have been an but a study of hillforts in Cheshire and Lancashire found that Buckton was topographically different from these sites and therefore unlikely to have been built in the Iron Age Excavation in 1998 demonstrated that the site was medieval with no sign of earlier activity The archaeologists and suggested that the castle was a a type of fortification where earthworks formed an integral part of the defence This was before excavation established that the first phase of the castle was a curtain wall and the earthworks seen today are the result of the collapse of the structure and accumulation of soil on top Buckton is now understood to be an enclosure castle with stone walls forming the key defence The Tameside Archaeology Survey began in 1990 carried out by the University of Manchester Archaeology Unit with more than 500 000 of funding from 300 000 of this was directed towards the excavations at Buckton Castle A topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record the castle earthworks and examine a possible outer bailey The latter was revealed to be a 20th century feature probably related to nearby mining activity Illegal digging by unknown parties in 1999 and 2002 necessitated remedial work and In 2007 full scale excavations at Buckton Castle began with the aim of establishing the date and history of the site Across three seasons 2007 2008 and 2010 trenches were opened across the ditch the northern entrance the gap in the circuit of earthworks on the south side the interior and the curtain wall The University of Manchester Archaeological Unit closed in July 2009 and the Tameside Archaeology Survey along with the work at Buckton Castle was transferred to the new Centre for Applied Archaeology at the University of Salford Brian Grimsditch directed the excavations throughout More than 60 were involved in the excavations between 2007 and 2010 including people from the the the and students from several universities Buckton was a small highland with a 2 8 metre thick 9 ft sandstone nothing survives above ground It is roughly oval and measures 35 6 by 26 2 metres 117 by 86 ft covering an area of 730 square metres 0 18 acres The castle is surrounded by a 10 metre wide 33 ft ditch apart from the south west part where the steep slope of the hill makes the ditch unnecessary When the ditch was dug some of the material was used to raise the interior of the castle by 1 5 metres 4 ft 11 in Buckton is similar in size to s inner enclosure which is also oval 31 8 by 26 metres 104 by 85 ft and has a 2 6 metre thick 9 ft curtain wall Clitheroe was also built on a rocky peak and the small size of its great tower may be due to its naturally defensible position and location in an economically deprived area Buckton Castle was entered through a in the north west measuring 9 3 by 7 5 metres 31 by 25 ft The east side was occupied by the gate passage and the west by a chamber Though the structure no longer survives above ground it was probably at least two storeys tall Constructed in the 12th century Buckton s gatehouse was the earliest in North West England and was one of six stone gatehouses in the region that were built in the 12th or 13th centuries Buckton Clitheroe inner gatehouse and the Agricola Tower at They are broadly similar in size and take the form of a gate passage piercing a single tower with rooms in the floors above Buckton s gatehouse differs slightly in having the passage offset to one side In the 1770s the antiquarian recorded a within the castle close to the south curtain and walls of buildings inside the castle still standing to a height of 2 metres 7 ft A plan created by the Saddleworth Geological Society in 1842 recorded a ruined structure within the castle s south east area in addition to the well Percival noted Trenches in the castle s interior did not reveal the structures on the plans from the 18th and 19th centuries although the discovery of a indicates there was activity in this area The gap in the southern part of the curtain wall not evident in the 1842 plan by the Saddleworth Geological Society was probably created in the 19th century There is a feature resembling a spoil heap consisting of pieces of sandstone This may have been a by product from the construction of the castle Nothing remains of Buckton Castle above ground today and until the late 20th century vegetation obscured the existence of a stone structure 
 pronounced is a about 2 miles 3 2 km south east of England The was founded by in the early 13th century The site near the confluence of the rivers and had been chosen by the for a called The castle is scheduled as an along with the fort as Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle In its earliest form the castle consisted of a stone with an and a wooden When the castle was built Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only in the region who were loyal to The Vieuxponts were a powerful land owning family in who also owned the castles of and In 1264 Robert de Vieuxpont s grandson also named Robert was declared a traitor and his property was confiscated by Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family and stayed in their possession until 1269 when the estates passed to the through marriage With the outbreak of the in 1296 Brougham became an important military base for He began refortifying the castle the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger more impressive stone walls and a large stone gatehouse was added The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that in 1300 he hosted King at the castle Robert s son was executed as a traitor in 1322 and the family estates passed into the possession of King although they were returned once his son became king The region was often at risk from the and in 1388 the castle was captured and sacked Following this the Cliffords began spending more time at their other castles particularly in Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords intermittently serving as a residence However by 1592 it was in a state of disrepair as was spending more time in southern England due to his role as The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century to such an extent that King was entertained there in 1617 In 1643 inherited the estates including the castles of Brougham Appleby and Brough and set about restoring them Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time after Lady Anne s death in 1676 however who had inherited the Clifford estates sold the furnishings in 1714 The empty shell was left to decay as it was too costly to maintain As a ruin Brougham Castle inspired a painting by and was mentioned at the start of s poem as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth s The castle was left to the in the 1930s and is today maintained by its successor The site of Brougham Castle has been fortified since the Romans erected the of at the intersection of three With the rivers and flowing nearby and meeting to the west the site had natural defences and the area was fertile and easy to cultivate A grew around the fort When arrived in the area they named the place meaning the village by the fort Between the end of Roman rule in the early 5th century and the in the late 11th century Cumbria was a turbulent area Although the site was a defendable position there is no evidence that Brougham was refortified during this time In 1092 also known as William Rufus captured Cumbria south of the and established a new border far north of Brougham The site at Brougham remained unfortified secured the border and castles at and both south east of Brougham protected the line of communication from to In 1203 the containing Appleby Brough and Brougham was granted to by King A favourite of John s Vieuxpont was one of only a few lords loyal to him in northern England whose inhabitants became so discontented with the king s rule that they eventually rebelled Around 1214 Vieuxpont asserted control over more land including half the of Brougham It was in this atmosphere of unrest that Brougham Castle was founded Vieuxpont was one of only a few supporters of the king in northern England and he most likely began construction of Brougham Castle as soon as he acquired the land At this stage the castle would have been enclosed by an earthen bank surmounted by a timber The first three storeys of the stone keep date from this period It was entered through the first floor via a forebuilding To the east of this was a stone structure which was probably a hall Building in stone was an expensive and time consuming process No records tell us how much Brougham cost to construct but there are records for other stone construction For example the late 12th century stone keep at in would have cost around 200 although something on a much larger scale such as the vast cost an estimated 15 000 20 000 and took several years to complete In 1216 when a Scottish army invaded the and occupied Westmorland Brougham Castle played no part in the county s defence probably because it was unfinished Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217 Vieuxpont received control over the king s revenues from Cumberland and these helped fund the construction of the castle Brougham Castle was constructed in the northern part of the old Roman fort and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228 his only son John was a minor so his property was taken into the care of a warden John de Vieuxpont died in 1241 before he came of age The new heir John s son Robert was not old enough to inherit so the family s lands remained in During this time the estates fell into disrepair and this probably included Brougham Castle When Robert de Vieuxpont came of age in around 1257 he inherited considerable debts He was one of the northern lords that revolted in support of in the 1264 1267 By June 1264 Vieuxpont was dead as he was considered a traitor his property was confiscated by King In 1266 the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously and his two daughters inherited the family estates The guardians of the two girls who at the time were too young to marry divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford the son of her guardian and with her the of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords By 1269 Roger Clifford had married Isabel Vieuxpont and possession of Brougham Castle as well as her other property descended through the Clifford family In 1283 Roger predeceased his wife who died in 1292 At 18 their son Robert was not old enough to take possession of his lands During his three year minority his estates suffered from neglect and When the began in 1296 Robert Clifford played a prominent role in the conflict As the furthest north of his castles Brougham became Clifford s most important base and he spent a lot of time there It was during this period that Clifford undertook an extensive building programme The timber palisade surrounding the site was replaced with a stone A four storey stone residential tower called the Tower of League was built in the castle s south west corner A fourth storey was added to the keep and a double gatehouse attached to its northern side The construction of a new stone hall to the south of the keep may indicate that during the war there was a larger garrison present than in peacetime or it may have been built in anticipation of a royal visit In July 1300 himself a renowned castle builder visited Brougham with a large household of followers and the Although it is not certain whether the king stayed at the castle historians believe it to have been likely In 1309 Robert Clifford was granted a Brougham Castle this has been taken as an indication that by this point the rebuilding was complete Licences to crenellate granted permission for a person to fortify a site They were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch who was the one responsible for granting permission Edward I died in 1307 and his successor was distracted from war with Scotland by internal quarrels enabling the Scottish to roam further south through England In 1310 or 1311 Robert Clifford was given Skipton Castle it was farther from the border than Brougham and at a time when Scottish raids were ravaging Westmorland Clifford chose to spend more time and effort building at Skipton Clifford was killed at the in 1314 which ended the English counter offensive into Scotland At the time of Robert s death his son Roger de Clifford 2nd Baron de Clifford was only 14 and not old enough to inherit Therefore the Clifford estates experienced another period of control through guardians suffering from Scottish raids to such an extent that in 1317 the king granted Roger 200 towards the maintenance of his castles was responsible for the upkeep of Brougham Castle and some other Clifford properties including Appleby Castle Between 1316 and 1318 he spent 363 on the garrisons at Brougham and Appleby though was supported by the king who gave 1 270 towards their upkeep Funds to pay the garrison were not easily gathered from the Clifford estates and they were accused of poaching and pillaging In 1320 Roger Clifford was given his inheritance but probably spent more time at Skipton He was executed as a traitor in 1322 after his capture at the Brougham Castle was amongst the Clifford lands confiscated and given to for supporting the king against the uprising However by 1323 Harcla too had been executed for treason and the castle came into the possession of Edward II In May 1323 a truce was signed between the Scots and English resulting in a reduction in garrison strength throughout northern England When replaced Edward II on the throne Roger s younger brother was granted most of the lands that had been confiscated By 1333 Robert had united under his control all the estates which had belonged to the Vieuxpont family Hostilities between England and Scotland resumed in 1332 when invaded to seize the Scottish throne for himself He was expelled from Scotland in December 1333 On entering Westmorland Balliol sought refuge with the Clifford family staying at the castles of Appleby Brougham Brough and Robert Clifford was not heavily involved in the renewed conflict although he did take part in battles in 1332 1337 and 1342 When the value of his property was assessed on his death in 1344 the estates of Brougham were suffering from the war with indications that Brougham Castle was in a state of disrepair having endured the 1340s without funds for maintenance Two minorities followed until came of age in 1354 Another truce between Scotland and England was signed in 1357 this time lasting until 1384 Although Roger Clifford spent much time at Appleby which was Westmorland s he was responsible for rebuilding the domestic buildings at Brougham Castle including the hall He was ordered by the king to maintain a force of 40 and 50 mounted archers near the west end of the Scottish border region and some were likely stationed at Brougham The need for extra accommodation is a possible reason why Clifford began rebuilding In August 1388 the Scottish launched an attack into England with one force advancing east and were eventually confronted at the in and another raiding the west reaching as far as Brough 20 miles 32 km to the south east During this time Brougham Castle was briefly captured by Scottish forces Roger Clifford died at Skipton Castle in 1389 and the Clifford family began to lose interest in Westmorland The Cliffords preferred their properties in Yorkshire to their dilapidated castles in Westmorland which had been ravaged by wars with Scotland Brougham Castle is not known to have been in use as a residence again until 1421 when a man was accused of forging coins in the castle Although little is known about Brougham during this period historians believe it likely that repairs were undertaken and a rivalry emerged between the Clifford family and the that would later have consequences for Brougham The familial enmity meant that the a Neville used his position as lord of Penrith to antagonise the Cliffords it is likely that Brougham Castle was kept garrisoned due to its proximity to Penrith In the 1455 1485 the two families were on opposing sides the Cliffords supporting the and the Nevilles supporting the When the Yorkist took the throne in 1461 the lands of were confiscated In 1471 Edward IV granted Sir Brougham Castle and other properties which had belonged to the Cliffords A year later John s son and heir was pardoned and when the Lancastrian took the throne as Henry VII Henry Clifford appealed for the return of the Clifford estates This was granted in November 1485 Henry Clifford lived until 1523 Under him and his son also called who later became the castle was intermittently in use as a residence for the family After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 it is likely that Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle although he was an unpopular landlord When the north of England rose up in the in 1536 Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels He confronted the rebel leaders at in February 1537 and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle After the Pilgrimage of Grace was suppressed there were reforms of regional government in the north west One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords northern most castle Henry died in 1542 and his son inherited the family estates During the in which Catholic rebelled against Henry remained loyal to the Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family He dismantled Appleby Castle to prevent it from being used against royal forces and at the same time put Brougham at the service of the Elizabethan government although there was no fighting at the castle Under the second and third earls Henry and the castle was still used as a residence with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle However it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted George Clifford spent much time either in southern England in his role as or at Skipton An inventory of the castle s contents in 1595 demonstrates that the structure was a neglected meagrely furnished place and what little furniture there was old and in disrepair When George Clifford died in 1605 his wife became countess and began repairing Brougham Castle which became her favoured residence Margaret contended with claims to the ownership of the family estates from her brother in law but held onto Brougham Castle Her daughter continued the restoration of the castle and other Clifford properties The only one of Margaret s three children to survive childhood Anne inherited the Clifford estates after her mother died in 1616 The inheritance was not without incident The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the Clifford estates however the found in favour of Anne The solution was only temporary and in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir and the Clifford estates passed to Francis Clifford Later the same year visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle Brougham and Appleby where expensive banquets were given in his honour It is estimated that the festivities cost around 1 200 After this Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected Francis Clifford died in 1641 and the death of his son in 1643 left the line without a direct male heir At this point the Clifford estates reverted to Lady Anne The broke out in 1641 Brougham was one of several castles in the generally Royalist Cumberland and Westmorland that were garrisoned by forces the garrison commander stated that he took control of Brougham Castle not because it was strategically important but to deny the of its use Whilst under Royalist control Lady Anne donated the income from her estates to the upkeep of her castles In June 1648 Appleby endured a four day siege before capitulating to the Parliamentarians but lightly manned Brougham Castle succumbed easily to Colonel Although many castles in Cumberland and Westmorland were so they could not be used again Brougham was spared this fate most likely because it was not strategically important In 1650 Lady Anne Clifford began repairing Appleby and Brougham Repairs were mostly complete by 1653 but continued for several years afterwards the work costing an estimated 40 000 By this time Brougham Castle was no longer a serious fortification and had become Anne s country house She laid out a garden on the site of the old Roman fort which led to the discovery of such Roman artefacts as coins and three altars A 10 5 foot 3 2 m stone wall was built around the garden enclosing an area from the gatehouse to the south end of the Roman fort Lady Anne Clifford died at Brougham Castle in 1676 and her grandson inherited the Clifford estates He died in 1679 and over the next five years possession passed through his three younger brothers Under the youngest Brougham Castle suffered particular neglect In 1714 he decided that was a sufficient residence and sold the contents of Brougham Castle for 570 Only the Tower of League was left untouched but in 1723 its contents were also sold for 40 By the 1750s the castle s only practical use was as a ready source of building material for the village of Brougham which prospered due to investment from the Earl of Thanet In 1794 a record of the dilapidated state of the castle noted that much of the interior walls have lately been removed also for the purposes of building houses for the adjoining farmhold During the late 18th century the became a popular visitor attraction and the sensibilities of glamorised such historic ruins as Brougham Castle In his poem William Wordsworth recounted exploring the ruins of Brougham as an adolescent with his sister Brougham also provided inspiration for another of Wordsworth s poems the The fallen castle attracted sightseers and such as and In his diary described Brougham Castle as a very fine ruin The painter visited Brougham in 1809 and 1831 and on the first occasion produced a sketch which would be the starting point of a later watercolour To avoid the castle decaying further spent 41 repairing the structure in 1830 and his successor undertook further repairs in the late 1840s costing 421 Henry Tufton died in 1849 and castle ownership fell to Maintenance was too expensive for the family and by 1859 cattle were being kept in its gatehouse and visitors complained that parts of the romantic ruin had become inaccessible Without sufficient funds the castle quickly fell into marked decay In 1915 the Ancient Monuments Board declared Brougham Castle a monument whose preservation was regarded as being of national importance With the introduction of bus services in the area the castle experienced renewed interest from the public and in the late 1920s around 2 000 people visited annually In 1927 the 2nd Baron Hothfield granted guardianship of Brougham Castle to the Office of Works although he retained ownership The organisation repaired the castle at the cost of 5 925 In the 1930s an additional 1 050 was spent removing the masonry added in the 1840s Brougham Castle survives essentially as it was when the main repairs were finished in the 1930s The castle is a meaning it is a nationally important historic building and which has been given protection against unauthorised change Until 1984 when a survey of the standing structure was conducted little archaeological investigation had taken place at Brougham Castle The survey was part of a monograph on the castle detailing its history and the phasing of the structure Brougham is one of only a few castles in Cumbria to have undergone extensive archaeological investigation Today the castle is open to the public and a museum is run by the successor of the Office of Works The path to Brougham Castle leads from east to west To the south or the left of someone approaching the castle are the earthworks of the Roman fort and the location of the 17th century garden The ground is terraced and to the north the land slopes down towards the River Eamont A moat runs alongside the east south and west faces of the castle its width varying between 33 49 feet 10 15 m and lying up to 11 feet 3 4 m deep Although the moat is now dry it is likely that it used to be filled with water The castle is an irregular polygon measuring about 223 ft 68 m along the west side 236 ft 72 m along the south 157 ft 48 m wide in the east and 177 ft 54 m on the north side Brougham Castle is entered through a three storey double gatehouse Originally the coat of arms of Roger Clifford and his wife was carved above the entrance to the gatehouse but in the 19th century this was replaced by the current inscription Thys Made Roger by Henry Tufton 11th Earl of Thanet The inscription was originally above the entrance of the great hall built by Roger Clifford 5th Baron Clifford Erected on the slope inclining down to the river the gatehouse was constructed in the early 14th century by Robert de Clifford 1st Baron de Clifford The complex has three components the inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between The inner gatehouse survives to a height of 41 ft 12 5 m in the east The ground floor passage through the building is and there was a at the east end A was hidden behind a buttress in the north side of the gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving the castle The floors above the passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to the keep allowing people to move between the two without having to go outside In the 17th century Lady Anne Clifford converted the top floor into her bedroom Like the inner gatehouse the outer section had a square plan and the upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room The building survives to a height of 48 ft 14 5 m in the east Below the outer gatehouse was a dungeon and at ground floor level on the north side the guardroom The large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences Although the very top of the gatehouse no longer survives it would have been crested by Adjoined to the gatehouse is the 13th century keep A keep contained the main domestic accommodation in a castle usually high status and also provided the last place of refuge if the surrounding enclosure fell during an assault Brougham s keep has a square plan and is between 62 66 ft 19 20 m high although originally would have stood taller Access to each floor was granted by a spiral staircase in the north east corner with each floor consisting of a single large room The was located in the north west corner It had long been assumed that the keep was built in the last quarter of the 12th century due to its simple design the square design use of narrow buttresses at each corner and entrance through a forebuilding are consistent with other keeps built in the late 12th century By the 13th century Brougham s keep would have been old fashioned compared to the polygonal structures introduced in the 13th century However historian Henry Summerson who assessed the historic documents for the castle concluded that construction could not have begun earlier than the first quarter of the 13th century The wooden floors no longer survive and the use of the rooms in the keep is mostly conjectural but it is likely that the ground floor would have served as a storage room with the first floor being used as a hall and accommodation for the guards and the second floor providing rooms for the lord A final fourth storey was added in early 14th century The keep would have been entered at first floor level through the east side where it was abutted by a forebuilding Despite the keep s importance to the castle structure little survives of the building today South east of the keep was the hall built by Roger Clifford in the late 14th century as a replacement for an earlier hall It provided space for the castle s garrison swelled by the Anglo Scottish Wars and was a location for the lord to eat with his soldiers The hall had large windows which may have detracted from the building s defensive capability although it has been postulated that casements bore large wooden shutters The kitchen which served the entire castle was set in the south east corner of the fortification Along the south wall were arranged more lodgings a well and a chapel the latter another addition by Roger Clifford In the south west corner of the castle was the Tower of League built around 1300 by Roger Clifford It included further rooms for accommodation but notably would also have allowed defenders to fire on an enemy emerging from the gatehouse Four storeys tall and with a single room at each level the presence of a garderobe and fireplace on each floor suggests that the tower was reserved for high status visitors The tower s square plan is typical of such structures built in northern England at this time as seen at castles such as and although it contrasts with rounded towers preferred in the south The antiquary visited Brougham Castle in 1725 and recorded local beliefs about certain monuments of stone south of Brougham Castle Turquin or Tarquin is also associated in folklore with the ruins of nearby The folklorist Marjorie Rowling identified him with another legendary local giant Hugh Cesario but and prefer to derive him from Sir Tarquin an adversary of Sir Lancelot in s they believe that this story unlocalized by Malory probably became associated with north west England because King Arthur was often said to hold his court in Carlisle 
 formerly the Lordship House is a 16th century in London It is named after the who formerly owned the land on which it is built Believed to stand on the site of an earlier building about which little is known the current house is one of the oldest surviving English brick houses It was remodelled in the 17th 18th and 19th centuries The house has been home to the and among others After serving as a school during the 19th century when a large extension was built to the west it was converted into a museum exploring the history of the areas now constituting and on the strength of its connection with Sir Rowland Hill the history of the The building also houses the archives of the London Borough of Haringey Since 1892 the grounds have been a public park Tottenham s oldest The name is derived from the who had historically owned a third of the of Tottenham However there was no castle in the area and it is unlikely that the family lived nearby Upon his accession to in 1306 forfeited his lands in England including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to and The three parts of the manor of Tottenham were united in the early 15th century under the Gedeney family and have remained united since In all early records the building is referred to as the The name first appears to have been adopted by 1635 1708 although Daniel Lysons speculates in 1795 the name s use dates to the late 13th century A detached cylindrical tower stands immediately to the south west of the house and is generally considered to be the earliest part of the building however Lysons believes it to have been a later addition The tower is built of local red brick and is 21 feet 6 4 m tall with walls 3 feet 0 91 m thick In 2006 excavations revealed that it continues for some distance below the current ground level It was described in 1829 as being over a deep well and being used as a dairy Sources disagree on the house s initial construction date and no records survive of its construction There is some archaeological evidence dating parts of the building to the 15th century William Robinson s 1840 suggests a date of about 1514 although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century speculates the front may have formed part of a of which the remainder has disappeared The Grade I mansion s principal facade has been substantially remodelled The house is made of red brick with and the principal facade terminated by symmetrical matching bays has tall paned windows The house and detached tower are among the earliest uses of brick as the principal building material for an English house 1635 1708 oversaw a substantial remodelling of the house in 1684 and much of the existing south facade dates from that time The end bays were heightened and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and a top and a small tower and A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house s centre with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east On the first floor the dining room was over the hall the main bedchamber over the kitchen and a lady s chamber over the porch In the early 18th century 1694 1749 oversaw a remodelling of the north of the house that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the pediment of the north facade In the late 18th century under the ownership of the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front and given the appearance of a typical house At the same time the south front s gabled attics were removed giving the house s southern elevation its current appearance An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall saloon drawing room dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor with a library and billiard room on the first floor In the early 19th century the house s west wing was demolished leaving it with the asymmetrical appearance it retains today The house was converted into a school and in 1870 a three story extension was built in the style to the northwest of the house The 2006 excavations by the uncovered the chalk foundations of an earlier building on the site of which nothing is known of 1742 refer to the repair of a implying that the building then had a A 1911 archaeological journal made passing reference to the recent levelling of the moat It is generally believed the house s first owner was to and one of the period s prominent courtiers who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514 However there is no evidence of Compton s living in the house and there is some evidence the building dates to a later period The earliest known reference to the building dates from 1516 when Henry VIII met his sister at Maister Compton s House beside Tottenham The Comptons owned the building throughout the 16th century but few records of the family or the building survive In the early 17th century and owned the house Sackville ran up high debts through gambling and extravagant spending the house then still called The Lordship House was leased to Peniston s wife Martha daughter of was

forces and returned upon the in a severe state of disrepair Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the are unknown Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667 having choked to death on a bone eating while laughing and drinking and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare 1635 1708 settled at the Lordship House renaming it Bruce Castle in honour of the area s historic connection with the Hare was a noted historian and author of the first history of Tottenham He grew up at the Hare family house at Totteridge and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham At the time of the birth of his first child Hugh in 1668 the family were still living in Totteridge while by the time of the death of his first wife Constantia in 1680 the family were living in Bruce Castle According to Hare Constantia was buried in in Tottenham However the for the period is complete and makes no mention of her death or burial Following the death of Constantia Hare married Sarah Alston They had been engaged in 1661 but she had instead married There is evidence that during Sarah s marriage to Seymour and Hare s marriage to Constantia a close relationship was sustained between them The house was substantially remodelled in 1684 following Henry Hare s marriage to the dowager Duchess of Somerset and much of the existing south facade dates from this time The facade s central tower with a is a of the English of the late 16th early 17th centuries also close to London had a similar central tower constructed in 1611 as does in Norfolk built circa 1616 Although sources such as Pegram speculate that Constantia committed suicide in the face of a continued relationship between Hare and the Duchess of Somerset little is known about her life and the circumstances of her early death and her ghost reputedly haunts the castle The earliest recorded reference to the ghost appeared in 1858 almost two hundred years after her death in the The legend has now been largely forgotten and there have been no reported sightings of the ghost in recent times Sarah Hare died in 1692 and was buried in and Hare in 1708 to be succeeded by his grandson Henry Hare was a leading residing only briefly at Bruce Castle between lengthy tours of Europe The house was remodelled again under the 3rd Baron Coleraine s ownership An extra range of rooms

Plessis du Plessis bore him his only child a daughter named Henrietta Rosa Peregrina born in France in 1745 Hare died in 1749 leaving his estates to the four year old Henrietta but her claim was rejected owing to her French nationality After many years of legal challenges the estates including Bruce Castle were granted to her husband whom she had married at age 18 James Townsend was a leading citizen of the day He served as a was Member of Parliament for and in 1772 became while Henrietta was a prominent artist many of whose of 18th century Tottenham survive in the Bruce Castle Museum

Although the British government did not offer them organised relief Wilmot in association with and founded Wilmot s Committee which raised funds to provide accommodation and food and found employment for refugees from France large numbers of whom settled in the Tottenham area In 1804 Wilmot retired from public life and moved to Bruce Castle to write his memoirs of the American Revolution and his role in the investigations of its causes and consequences They were published shortly before his death in 1815 After Wilmot s death London merchant John Ede purchased the house and its grounds and demolished the building s west wing Hill and his brothers had taken over the management of their father s school in in 1819 which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827 with Rowland Hill as Headmaster The school was run along lines inspired by Hill s friends and all teaching was on the principle that the teacher s role is to instill the desire to learn not to impart facts corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils while the school taught a radical for the time curriculum including foreign languages science and engineering Among other pupils the school taught the sons of many London based diplomats particularly from the newly independent nations of South America and the sons of computing pioneer In 1839 Rowland Hill who had written an influential proposal on postal reform was appointed as head of the where he introduced the world s first postage stamps leaving the school in the hands of his younger brother Arthur Hill During the period of the School s operation the character of the area had changed beyond recognition Historically Tottenham had consisted of four villages on later the surrounded by marshland and farmland The construction of the in 1840 with stations at and later Northumberland Park made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time albeit by a circuitous eight mile route via more than double the distance of the direct road route as well as providing direct connections to the In 1872 the opened a direct line from to including a station at close to Bruce Castle the railway provided subsidised workmen s fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London As a major rail hub Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area by the end of the 19th century the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself and the waterlogged floodplains of the at and of the at In 1877 Birkbeck

 is a largely in within the Greater Manchester England It is a building the oldest parts of which date from the 14th century with later additions from the 16th and 19th centuries The house which functions as a museum and its 70 acres 28 ha of landscaped parkland with lakes woodland and gardens are open to the public Dating back to the manor of Bramall was first described in the in 1086 when it was held by the Masseys From the late 14th century it was owned by the Davenports who built the present house and remained lords of the manor for about 500 years before selling the estate of nearly 2 000 acres in 1877 to the Manchester Freeholders Company a property company formed expressly for the purpose of exploiting the estate s potential for residential building development The Hall and a residual park of over 50 acres was sold on by the Freeholders though not the lordship of the manor to the Nevill family of successful industrialists In 1925 it was purchased by and then in 1935 acquired by the local government authority for the area Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council Following local government reorganisation in 1974 Bramall Hall is now owned by SMBC which describes it as the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area The name Bramall means nook of land where broom grows and is derived from the noun meaning a type of shrub common in the area and the Old English noun which has several meanings including nook secret place and valley that could refer to Bramall The manor of Bramall dates from the when it was held as two separate estates owned by the freemen Brun and Hacun The manor was devastated during s After William subdued the north west of England the land was divided among his followers and Bramall was given to in around 1070 The earliest reference to Bramall was recorded in the as Bramale at which time the manor was part of the in Cheshire With and Bramall was one of three places described in the that today lie within the modern day While its value was 32 shillings before 1066 it was worth only 5 shillings by 1086 In the first part of the 12th century the manor passed from the second to Matthew de Bromale According to Dean Matthew s father is said to have founded the de Bromale family naming himself after the manor and he may have been related to or a follower of the de Masseys He may have also held the manor at some point The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married and the family name was changed The Davenports were a family of significant landowners in the north west of England whose antecedents can be traced back to the time of the Orm de Davenport lived close to what is now and his name derives from the meaning the town on the trickling stream referring to his home on the In 1160 the family became responsible for and in the early 13th century Vivian Davenport became its Grand Sergeant The family s includes a man s head with a rope around the neck which is said to represent the family s power over life and death during this period The Davenports acquired land throughout the area notably at and lastly at Bramhall through marriage The Davenports held the manor for around 500 years and it is likely that they built the current house after their accession The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528 and one of the first recorded trustees of It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the at and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime According to Dean it was during this first William s tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt replacing or partially replacing an older building The third William Davenport who succeeded his father of the same name in 1541 took part in what later became known as a series of attacks against Scotland ordered by He was knighted in Scotland for his efforts at the The fifth William Davenport inherited Bramall in 1585 from his father of the same name and lived there with his wife Dorothy for over 50 years The first marriage in Bramall s chapel was recorded in 1599 between William aged 15 eldest son of the fifth William and Dorothy and Frances Wilbraham aged 11 On 22 April 1603 the fifth William Davenport was knighted by at where the king was staying on his journey from Edinburgh to London and later became the High Sheriff of Cheshire and a commissioner of the Hundred of Macclesfield During the tenure of the fifth William many alterations were made to the building including the addition of a room above the Great Hall which would later become the Withdrawing Room and a The internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits The sixth William succeeded his father in 1639 shortly before the broke out He was a though said not to have been a particularly dedicated one Many of his tenants became Parliamentarian soldiers and over the next three years he had numerous visits from Parliamentarian soldiers mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for the war and using the house for quartering soldiers Bramall was also host to Royalist soldiers who confiscated some of the Davenport property for use in the war William Davenport was at one point charged with and ordered to pay a fine of 750 equivalent to 130 000 in 2020 and soldiers continued to use Bramall Hall because of its convenience The sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter who was followed by his son William William the seventh s son was the eighth William Davenport and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport Warren became part of the clergy and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father Warren at the age of four Many changes were made to the house during his tenure including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe William had no sons so the estate passed to the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria Humphreys a Naval captain had married Maria Davenport in 1810 and lived at Bramall Hall long before he succeeded his father in law He became widely respected in the Stockport area but following his succession to the estate in 1829 there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property Edmund Davenport who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport the third son of Peter unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport in an effort to continue the Davenport line He moved with Maria to in 1841 most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Over the next decade the house was likely to have been let as Maria Davenport preferred to live elsewhere Her eldest son William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt then secondly to Diana Handley whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son Charles and died in 1866 During William s tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship However following his death in 1869 the property was let to of Christys Co Hatting therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family This occurred because William s son John was too young to inherit the estate John s whereabouts during Christy s seven year tenure is unknown though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871 and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board In 1876 shortly before he returned to the house he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall John Davenport returned to Bramall in 1876 at the age of 25 but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold The furniture was auctioned while the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate totalling was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited a property development firm on 3 August 1877 for 200 000 about 19 million in 2020 According to speculation the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill a local industrialist whose wealth came from printing for his son Charles While living in the house Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building s external features The landscape of the grounds was redesigned and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge housing the coachman and head gardener respectively Another building known as Hall Cottage was also built in the vicinity and housed the Sidebottom family Thomas Nevill Charles nephew and adopted son inherited the estate in 1916 but decided to sell it following financial difficulties after the First World War In 1923 many items of furniture were auctioned off but there was no interest in purchase of the house During that decade rumours arose that Bramall would be dismantled and transported to the United States this may have been popularised by the autobiography of which described the author s visit to Bramall in 1890 In 1925 the house was auctioned with the condition that if no purchaser came forward it would be demolished and the materials sold off At one point the neighbouring local authority Stockport County Borough Council offered to buy the estate but Nevill rejected their offer as unacceptable The auction received no acceptable offers However one of those present president of later offered 15 000 about 862 000 in 2020 for the house this was accepted He lived in the house until his death in 1927 and his widow Amy remained there until 1935 when she sold it to for 14 360 worth about 1 004 000 in 2020 with the intention that the house and park be open to the public Under council ownership the house was occupied by a caretaker though most of the building was open to the public The house and grounds were used for various functions such as the proclamation of succeeding his brother to the throne At that time the house was sparsely furnished as the Council was unable to afford much furniture One of the Council s earliest projects was the restoration of the Chapel which had fallen out of use towards the end of the 19th century It was restored to resemble how it would have been when the Davenports were last at Bramall and a service of consecration was held on 30 October 1938 once the work had been completed In 1947 an association called the Friends of Bramall Hall was set up primarily to find furnishings for the house but also to advertise and assist in the upkeep of the house and grounds Over the years many furnishings which had once belonged to the house were returned including portraits of the occupants The estate is now the property of SMBC which acquired it in 1974 following local government reorganisation The house and grounds are open to the public and are run by SMBC Visitors may take an official tour of the house or explore it at their own pace on a self guided basis The public is able to wander the grounds freely at all times Events and club meetings are held in the house and grounds throughout the year and local schools often visit to experience life in a particular era The house is licensed for wedding and civil partnership ceremonies and has been used as a background for television series and films including and Although the house and the park are currently officially known by the name Bramall both have been spelled as Bramhall Bramal and other variations over the years The used the spelling Bramale which led Charles Nevill to prefer Bramall a convention maintained by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council when it acquired the property and continued by Stockport Council Generally the hall is now referred to as Bramall Hall whilst the name of the park village and manor are spelt Bramhall though there remain some local inconsistencies There has been a settlement at Bramhall since Saxon times According to Alfred Burton who wrote about Bramhall in the late 19th century the house has not always been in the present location and was originally at Crow Holt Wood This theory was rejected by another historian Frederick Moorhouse who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides which two streams run through It is a grade I and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries It was originally accessed from the east side the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side reaching the courtyard on the other side The main entrance is now on the side of the courtyard in the west because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888 The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building in the courtyard the service wing is on the left the Great Hall is in the centre and the Banqueting Hall is on the right Before the 19th century the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down between 1774 and 1819 because of its being neither required nor in vogue The house is built with stone foundations and the main structure is made of timbers joined together using and held in place with oak pegs or and are used to fill the spaces between the timbers The black and white appearance from the construction dates from the Tudor period though some parts have been repaired in later years The Great Hall is the central part of Bramall Hall As with typical in the Middle Ages this would have been the room where the business of the house estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household It was originally an open roofed single storey building with a fireplace situated in the middle of the floor It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor Towards the end of the 16th century the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt and the Withdrawing Room was created above it A was also added as a third storey The history of the gallery is uncertain it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819 because it was believed to be unsafe A similar gallery was built at and it is still intact causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight The Great Hall has a with leaded windows common throughout the building wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall in his 1834 novel He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall and be entertained and sometimes refreshed He described Bramall as the best specimen of its class its class in our opinion is the best to be met with in Cheshire No evidence exists for any such right of way According to another tale food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside The Lesser Hall leads off the southern end of the Great Hall Its walls are panelled with oak and the timbers that the ceiling is constructed of are decorated with cross and rose shapes dating from the Victorian era The Banqueting Hall which leads off the Lesser Hall to the west is believed by Dean to be the oldest part of the house Its northern wall is possibly the oldest part of the house not having been renovated like the rest of the courtyard walls The Nevills used this room as a The Chapel opposite the Banqueting Hall was the only place of public worship in Bramhall until the 19th century Its existence was first recorded in 1541 when it was referred to in the will of the second William Davenport It fell into disrepair after its closure between 1869 and 1890 and was restored by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council following its purchase of the property in 1935 and religious services began to be held there again On the north wall are unglazed windows which face the wall of the Library showing that the south wing was once separate from the Great Hall The are written on the west wall Underneath the Commandments an older pre painting is visible Such depictions were banned during the Reformation and whitewashed over It was not until the 20th century that efforts were made to restore Passion paintings but very little of this particular painting survives The also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century It contains rare 16th century wall murals including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room also known as the Queen Anne Room the Priest s Room and Nevill s Room It had been two rooms a state bedroom and but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room A blocked up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of and their fall from paradise as well as the use in Tudor times of the name paradise for a favourite room often a bedchamber This room has panelled walls and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side On the other side there is a small recess which was described in an 1882 newspaper as a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown It is possible that this was a priest s hide adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room Less romantically it may alternatively have been a garderobe or privy This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose though no such passages exist The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room situated above the Great Hall It has an elaborate plaster ceiling and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports The northern wing of Bramall came to be the service wing with the kitchen scullery butler s pantry dairy and store rooms on the ground floor and the servants bedrooms in the attic The house is set in around 70 acres 28 ha of parkland only a part of the estate originally attached to the house which was at one time about 2 000 acres 810 ha in extent The park was used for hunting and the grounds were home to cattle deer and horses until the 17th century when it was used as agricultural land Two water courses run through the park the which a little beyond the Park becomes the Micker Brook before flowing into the River Mersey and a stream known as the Carr Brook In the 1880s Charles Nevill remodelled the grounds in the Romantic Victorian taste altering the course of the Ladybrook adding considerably to the trees in the park and creating artificial ponds The ponds were stocked with though they are no longer fished In 1888 a new drive was made through the park a few yards further to the south of the house than the previous drive and below the East Front of the house Nevill set out terraces The park is open to the public and features woodland open grass areas gardens a café a bowling green and children s play areas Media related to at Wikimedia Commons

of the palace Where the river was fordable at Cow Ford the village of Eye Cross grew Ownership of the site changed hands many times owners included and his in late Saxon times and after the William gave the site to who bequeathed it to the monks of In 1531 acquired the Hospital of St James which became from and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century By then the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay and the area was mostly wasteland Needing money sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4 acre 1 6 ha mulberry garden for the production of silk This is at the north west corner of today s palace in 1649 refers to new erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S James s this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery Eventually in the late 17th century the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir by the great heiress Mary Davies Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake around 1624 The next owner was who from 1633 extended Blake s house and developed much of today s garden then known as Goring Great Garden He did not however obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden Unbeknown to Goring in 1640 the document failed to pass the before fled London which it needed to do for legal execution It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under When the improvident Goring defaulted on his rents was able to purchase the lease of Goring House and he was occupying it when it burned down in 1674 following which he constructed Arlington House on the site the location of the southern wing of today s palace the next year In 1698 later the first acquired the lease The house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first in 1703 to the design of The style chosen was of a large three floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham s illegitimate son in 1761 to George III for 21 000 Sheffield s on the mulberry garden site the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family was due to expire in 1774 Under the new Crown ownership the building was originally intended as a private retreat for King George III s wife and was accordingly known as Remodelling of the structure began in 1762 In 1775 an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte in exchange for her rights to and 14 of her 15 children were born there Some furnishings were transferred from and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution of 1789 While remained the official and ceremonial royal residence the name Buckingham palace was used from at least 1791 After his accession to the throne in 1820 continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small comfortable home However in 1826 while the work was in progress the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo classical influence preferred by George IV The cost of the renovations grew dramatically and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash s designs resulted in his removal as the architect On the death of George IV in 1830 his younger brother hired to finish the work After the destruction of the by fire in 1834 William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837 on the accession of Queen Victoria who was the first monarch to reside there her predecessor William IV had died before its completion While the were a riot of gilt and colour the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious For one thing it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down and consequently the palace was often cold Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled and when it was decided to install gas lamps there was a serious worry about the build up of gas on the lower floors It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty Following the Queen s marriage in 1840 her husband concerned himself with a reorganisation of the offices and staff and with addressing the design faults of the palace By the end of 1840 all the problems had been rectified However the builders were to return within the decade By 1847 the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family and consequently the new wing designed by Edward Blore was built by enclosing the central quadrangle The large East Front facing is today the public face of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual The wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period designed by

usual royal ceremonies investitures and presentations Widowed in 1861 the grief stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at and For many years the palace was seldom used even neglected In 1864 a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace saying These commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant s declining business

 The is a boar crested helmet from the 7th century AD It was excavated by in 1848 from a at the farm in in western The grave had probably been looted by the time of Bateman s excavation but still contained other high status objects suggestive of a richly furnished burial such as the The helmet is displayed at s which purchased it from Bateman s estate in 1893 The helmet was constructed by covering the outside of an iron framework with plates of horn and the inside with cloth or leather the organic material has since decayed It would have provided some protection against weapons but was also ornate and may have been intended for ceremonial use It was the first Anglo Saxon helmet to be discovered five others from and have been found since The helmet features a unique combination of structural and technical attributes but contemporaneous parallels exist for its individual characteristics It is classified as one of the crested helmets used in Northern Europe from the 6th to 11th centuries AD The most striking feature of the helmet is the boar at its apex this pagan symbol faces towards a on the in a display of This is representative of 7th century England when Christian missionaries were slowly converting Anglo Saxons away from traditional The helmet seems to exhibit a stronger preference toward paganism with a large boar and a small cross The cross may have been added for talismanic effect the help of any god being welcome on the battlefield The boar atop the was likewise associated with protection and suggests a time when boar crested helmets may have been common as do the helmet from Wollaston and the The contemporary epic mentions such helmets five times and speaks of the strength of men when the hefted sword its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood razes the sturdy boar ridge off a helmet The Benty Grange helmet was made by covering an iron frame with horn It probably weighed about 1 4 kg 3 1 lb the weight of the Weston Park Museum s 1986 replica The framework which now exists in sixteen corroded fragments originally consisted of seven iron strips each between 1 and 2 millimetres thick A brow band 65 cm 26 in long and 2 5 cm 1 0 in wide encircled the head Two strips of the same width ran from front to back and from side to side The 40 cm 16 in long nose to band extended 4 75 cm 1 87 in in the front and 3 8 cm 1 5 in in the back the extension over the nose was straight whereas the extension at the back was curved inwards so as to fit the nape of the wearer The lateral band ran from ear to ear both ends are broken off slightly below the brow band but it would have extended further as part of a cheek or ear protection It was affixed to the outside of the wearer s right side of the brow band the inside of the wearer s left side and the outside of the nose to nape band The four quadrants created by this configuration were each subdivided by a narrower subsidiary strip of iron only one of which now survives Each subsidiary strip was attached to the outside of the brow band 7 cm 2 8 in from the centre of the lateral band Here they were 22 mm 0 87 in wide and while tapering towards a width of 15 mm 0 59 in rose at a 70 angle towards the lateral band which they overlapped at a 50 angle just beneath the crest The inside of the helmet was most likely originally lined with leather or cloth since decayed Eight plates of horn probably softened and bent and suggested to be from were cut to fit the eight spaces created by the iron frame No horn now survives but mineralized traces on the iron strips preserve the grain pattern The plates were fitted over the iron thereby hiding it and abutted at the centre of each strip The joins were hidden by further pieces of horn that were cut to the width of the iron strips and placed on top The three layers iron at the bottom followed by two layers of horn were held together by a succession of iron rivets placed from inside the helmet and rivets made of or coated in silver with ornamental heads in the shape of a double headed axe placed from the outside 4 cm 1 6 in apart Traces of horn on the rear extension of the nose to nape band and on the rear brow band suggest that the material was also used for a neck guard These suggest that pieces of horn extending 5 cm 2 0 in from the centre of the brow band to the bottom of the rear nose to nape band would have met each extension of the lateral band at a 5 angle reaching them 6 4 cm 2 5 in from the centre of the brow band In addition to the aesthetic elements incorporated into the basic construction of the helmet two features provide added decoration a cross on the and a boar on the crest The silver cross is 3 9 cm 1 5 in long by 2 cm 0 8 in wide and consists of two parts A silver strip was added underneath elongating what was originally an equal armed cross It was placed atop a layer of horn and attached to the helmet with two rivets one at the intersection of the two arms and one at the bottom Around the cross in a zigzag pattern are twenty nine silver studs out of a suggested original forty that were probably tapped into small holes drilled or bored into the horn The most distinctive feature of the Benty Grange helmet is its boar affixed to the apex of the helmet The core of its body is made of two pieces of hollow D sectioned bronze tubes their flat sides approximately 2 mm 0 08 in apart The space between the two halves was filled in with a substance likely horn or metal which has now disintegrated it perhaps projected upwards forming the mane or spine of the boar or as has been interpreted on the replica created a recess into which a mane of actual boar bristles could fit On either side of the bronze core was affixed a plate of iron forming the visible exterior of the boar Four shaped plates of silver cut down and filed from Roman silver as evidenced by a classical leaf design on the reverse of the front left plate and file marks on the acted as hips through which passed two silver rivets one atop the other per end These rivets held together the five layers of the boar and were welded to the plates Into the body of the boar were placed holes probably punched that held circular silver studs approximately 1 5 mm 0 06 in in diameter The studs likely flush with the surface of the body were filed down and gilded and may have been intended to represent golden bristles Eyes were formed with 5 mm 0 20 in long pointed oval set into gold sockets with wire edging The sockets were 8 mm 0 31 in long by 3 5 mm 0 14 in wide and had 8 mm 0 31 in long shanks filled with sunk into the head Individual pieces of gilded bronze seem to have formed the tail tusks muzzle jawline and ears of the boar but few traces of them now remain Two sets of iron legs probably solid originally but rendered hollow by corrosion attached the body to an elliptical bronze plate both sets depict front legs bent forwards without account for the anatomical differences between a boar s fore and hind limbs The elliptical plate is 9 cm 3 5 in long with a maximum width of 1 9 cm 0 75 in and matches the curvature of the helmet Four holes indicate attachment points for the legs and another three connected the plate to the frame of the helmet in addition to a large rivet hole slightly behind the centre The plate was probably affixed directly to the frame the legs passing through holes in the horn The Benty Grange helmet would have both offered some protection if worn in battle and indicated its wearer s status As the Weston Park replica shows it would have originally been an impressive object and may have been intended for ceremonial use Experiments using a mockup of the replica also showed that the helmet would have resisted blows with an which damaged the horn without entirely breaking it Arrows and spears pierced the horn but they also pierced modern fibreglass and safety helmets Helmets were rare in Anglo Saxon England and the Benty Grange helmet both by its richness and its scarcity signified the high status of its owner Such protection certainly seems to have been among the armour of the affluent In the contemporary epic a poem about kings and nobles they are relatively common while the helmeted and graves from the same period in Sweden thought to be the burials of wealthy non royals suggest that helmets were not solely for the use of the élite Yet thousands of furnished Anglo Saxon graves have been excavated since the start of the 19th century and helmets remain rare this may partly reflect poor rates of artefact survival or even recognition but their extreme scarcity indicates that they were never deposited in great numbers The helmet was discovered in a on the farm in Derbyshire in what is now the National Park an archaeologist and antiquarian who led the excavation described Benty Grange as a high and bleak situation its barrow which still survives is prominently located by a major Roman road now the possibly to display the burial to passing travellers It may have also been designed to share the skyline with two other nearby monuments and barrow The seventh century Peak District was a small buffer state between and occupied according to the by the Anglo Saxon The area came under the fold of the kingdom around the eighth century the Benty Grange and other rich barrows suggest that the Pecsæte may have had their own dynasty beforehand but there is no written evidence for this Bateman excavated the barrow on 3 May 1848 Although he did not mention it in his account he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave The fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by 6 ft 1 8 m and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent such as a sword and shield suggests that the grave had previously been looted Being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two burials only one of which was discovered by Bateman The barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately 15 m 50 ft in diameter and 0 6 m 2 ft high an encircling fosse about 1 m 3 3 ft wide and 0 3 m 1 ft deep and outer penannular earthworks around 3 m 10 ft wide and 0 2 m 0 66 ft high The entire structure measures approximately 23 by 22 m 75 by 72 ft Bateman suggested a body once lay at its centre flat against the original surface of the soil of which little remained what he described as the one remnant strands of hair is now thought to be from a cloak of fur cowhide or something similar The recovered objects were found in two clusters One cluster was found in the area of the supposed hair the other about 6 ft 1 8 m to the west In the former area Bateman described a curious assemblage of ornaments which were difficult to remove successfully from the hardened earth This included a cup identified as leather but probably of wood approximately 3 in 7 6 cm in diameter at the mouth Its rim was edged with silver while its surface was decorated by four wheel shaped ornaments and two crosses of thin silver affixed by pins of the same metal clenched inside Also found were of three escutcheons as well as a knot of very fine wire and some thin bone variously ornamented with lozenges c attached to silk but that soon decayed when exposed to air Approximately 6 ft 1 8 m to the west of the other objects was found a jumbled mass of ironwork Separated this mass included a collection of chainwork a six pronged piece of iron resembling a and the helmet As Bateman described it Bateman closed his 1849 account of the excavation by noting the particularly corrosive nature of the soil which by 1861 he said has generally been the case in tumuli in Derbyshire He suggested that this was the result of a mixing or tempering with some corrosive liquid the result of which is the presence of thin ochrey veins in the earth and the decomposition of nearly the whole of the human remains Bateman s friend an artist and antiquarian who frequently accompanied Bateman on excavations painted four watercolours of the finds parts of which were included in Bateman s 1849 account This was more than Jewitt produced for any other of their excavations a mark of the importance that they assigned to the Benty Grange barrow The helmet entered the extensive collection of Bateman where it attracted interest On 27 October 1848 he related his discoveries including the helmet to the and in 1855 it was catalogued along with other objects from the Benty Grange barrow In 1861 Bateman died at 39 and in 1876 his son Thomas W Bateman loaned the objects to Sheffield They were displayed at the through 1893 at which time the museum purchased objects including the helmet from the family other pieces were dispersed elsewhere As of 2020 the helmet remains in the collection of the museum From 8 November 1991 to 8 March 1992 it joined the at the for The Benty Grange barrow was designated a on 23 October 1970 The list entry notes that a lthough the centre of Benty Grange barrow has been partially disturbed by excavation the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains It goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information The nearby farm was renovated between 2012 and 2014 as of 2020 it is rented out as a holiday cottage In 1948 the helmet was brought to the British Museum to undergo cleaning and study Permission to carry out the work had been requested the previous year when recently returned from service in the to an assistant keepership at the museum spent time in Sheffield examining the Benty Grange A 1940 letter from to Bruce Mitford s army camp had assigned him his position and responsibility for the discoveries Brace yourself for the task the letter concluded Upon his return he therefore took to studying the comparison material his work in 1947 included the excavation of the Valsgärde 11 boat grave in Sweden alongside and the trip to Sheffield intended to shed light on the through comparison with the only other Anglo Saxon helmet then known Permission was obtained from the curator and trustees of the Weston Park Museum for the proposed work and in April 1948 a century and a month after its discovery the Benty Grange helmet was brought to London Work at the British Museum was overseen by keeper of the research laboratory who in some cases particularly with the boar did the work himself additional input was provided by Bruce Mitford the technical attaché and authority on ancient metalwork and the archaeologist and art historian In the hundred years following its exposure to the air the helmet had continued to corrode and certain parts had become indiscernible The boar was unrecognizable and the silver rivets and cross were almost completely obscured A strong needle was used to pick off the encrustation revealing the underlying features During this process the boar hitherto thought solid snapped in two Bruce Mitford termed this occurrence fortunate for it revealed the boar s inner structure examined the remnants of horn at the and conducted experiments softening and shaping modern horn The Benty Grange helmet is dated to the first half of the 7th century AD on the basis of its technical construction and decorative style It is one of six helmets joined by the subsequent discoveries from and These are all other than the Frankish Shorwell helmet examples of the crested helmets known in in the 6th through 11th centuries AD Such helmets are characterized by prominent crests and rounded caps traits shared by the Benty Grange example and other than a fragment found in uniformly originate from England or Scandinavia contemporary continental helmets were primarily or The ultimate form of the helmet is unparalleled among surviving Anglo Saxon and crested helmets although individual characteristics are shared While other Anglo Saxon helmets were typically formed with wide perpendicular bands and four infill plates their Swedish counterparts from Vendel and Valsgärde display similar use of thin iron frameworks The complicated construction of the Benty Grange boar which combines garnet filigree gold silver iron and bronze is unique across ornamental Anglo Saxon objects but the general boar crest is paralleled by the Wollaston and boars One other helmet exhibits the use of horn but it is the spangenhelm type helmet of a high status child discovered in The helmet was made during the nascent days of and exhibits both and motifs The boar invoked a pagan tradition and the cross a Christian belief had been officially converted to Christianity in the fourth century although Celtic paganism remained strong In the fifth century Ireland was converted by British missionaries and in 563 Irish missionaries based in the monastery of off the western coast of Scotland embarked on the conversion of the Christianity almost disappeared in southern Britain after its conquest by the pagan Anglo Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries apart from the surviving Celtic areas of southwest England and Wales In 597 Pope sent the to Kent to embark on the conversion of the Anglo Saxons It rapidly converted kingdoms as far north as Northumbria but initial success was often followed by a period of apostasy and in several cases the final conversion was carried out by Irish missionaries from Iona It is not known whether the Pecsæte were converted by adherents of the Roman or Irish Celtic tradition The Benty Grange helmet was made during this time of change as evidenced by its display It emphasises the pagan element a large boar dominating a small cross The cross may not necessarily be an indication of Christian belief it may have instead been chosen for its effect Whatever the politics behind religious conversion the battlefield was not a place to discriminate against gods The had symbolic import in prehistoric Europe where according to the archaeologist it was venerated eulogised hunted and eaten for millennia until its virtual extinction in recent historical time Anglo Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography coming after examples in the 4th century BC specimens three centuries later and Roman boars in the 4th century AD They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures The boar is said to have been sacred to a figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Europe while the Roman historian writing around the 1st century AD suggested that the wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection Boar crested helmets are depicted on the turn of the millennium discovered in Denmark and on a from Sweden made 500 years later The Romans also included the boar as one of their many symbols four including the adopted it as their emblem The boar persisted in continental during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain such as in association with the Scandinavian gods and Its return to prominence in the Anglo Saxon period as represented by the boars from Benty Grange Wollaston Guilden Morden and may therefore suggest the post Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule Whatever its precise symbolism the Anglo Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection the poet makes this clear writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them The Benty Grange helmet recalls the Anglo Saxon poem in which boar adorned helmets are mentioned five times Three passages appear to describe examples that like the Benty Grange helmet are topped with a freestanding boar After is killed by King s lamentation speaks of such helmets The devastation wrought by Grendel s mother itself invokes a boar crested helmet for h er onslaught was less only by as much as an amazon warrior s strength is less than an armed man s when the hefted sword its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood razed the sturdy boar ridge off a helmet These two passages likely refer to boar crests like those found on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets and the detached Guilden Morden boar 
 The is a paper record of ships of the English of the 1540s named after its creator Anthony Anthony It originally consisted of three rolls of depicting 58 naval vessels along with information on their size crew armament and basic equipment The rolls were presented to in 1546 and were kept in the royal library In 1680 gave two of the rolls to who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book which is now in the at The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by to his daughter who sold it to the in 1858 it is now owned by the The Anthony Roll is the only known fully illustrated inventory of ships of the English navy in the As the work of a successful state official in 16th century England the artistic value of the Anthony Roll has been described as being characterised by naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern though its artistic aspects display a decent amateur grasp of form and colour While the inventories listed in its text have proven to be highly accurate most of the ship illustrations are rudimentary and made according to a set formula The level of detail of the ship design armament and especially rigging has therefore proven to be only approximate Nevertheless through their depiction of the ceremonial ornamentation the illustrations in the Roll have provided relevant secondary information to the study of Tudor period and ship ornamentation The only known contemporary depictions of prominent Tudor era vessels like the and the are contained in the Anthony Roll As the sank by accident in 1545 and was successfully salvaged in 1982 comparison between the information in the Roll and the physical evidence of the has provided new insights into the study of the naval history of the period has been identified as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature which has been compared with letters among the State Papers Anthony s father was William Anthony died 1535 a from in who migrated to England in 1503 William was a supplier of beer to the army and Anthony followed in his father s footsteps He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the a position he retained nominally until his death He rose to the rank of overseer of the the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower and elsewhere for life He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces and was active in the last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against In 1939 Dutch historian Nicholas Beets proposed that the Flemish artist and cartographer or Antonisz c 1507 1553 could have been Anthony Anthony s brother Although Beets suggestion of kinship was conjectural and without any direct evidence it was picked up by in the in 1963 and has been relayed by several other authors The will of William Anthony did not mention any other sons and Anthonisz is believed to have been the son of Antonis Egbertson the daughter of That Cornelis and Anthony were related is in the words of Ann Payne not presumably impossible but there is little evidence that they were connected at all The ship portrait had a long history in from medieval seals and coins to early in the 15th century and the plain side on view of a ship under sail often with no crew shown was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors Contemporary maps or plats were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes Such maps were common at the time and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab The navy was expanded during s reign and he was known to take an interest in warships as can be seen by the epic painting which portrayed if rather unrealistically the ships that took the 29 year old king to the summit meeting with at the in 1520 This painting recently dated to around 1545 has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony the route of from the to England 1539 a French attack on a coastal fort date unknown and a French raid on Brighton July 1545 The design of the ships in these paintings especially that of the Brighton raid closely match those in the rolls It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated 1546 The inclusion of the that sank at the 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549 The the and all present in the second roll were still being built around March 1546 and the was not at sea until October that year At the same time the captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included After the rolls were presented to the king they were archived in the royal collections In 1680 gave two of the rolls to a navy administrator and avid book collector Pepys did not disclose the details of how the rolls were given to him but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys took down the king s account of how he escaped from the 1651 The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story but he never did so It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task but this project also was never finished It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story The second roll could not be located at that time and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne keeper of the royal library 1677 89 and a close friend of Pepys Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of and which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time After Pepys death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library along with the codex was then passed on to Pepys old college at where it remains to this day The second roll was presumed lost by the 1780s but actually remained in the hands of the royal family gave it to his illegitimate daughter sometime in the early 19th century In 1824 FitzClarance married Charles Robert Fox a major general and from 1832 35 an officer of the surveyor of the ordnance the same position Anthony Anthony had three centuries before him Fox was a and historian Charles Knighton has suggested he knew the value of the roll but its location nevertheless remained unknown to scholars In 1857 keeper of manuscripts at the was shown the second roll and learned that Mary Fox wished to sell it After negotiations it was sold for 15 to the British Museum and was numbered 22047 It was kept in its original format as a roll and has been stored in the s manuscript collection at since 1999 The Anthony Roll has been used frequently as a primary source for histories of the English navy of the 16th century but the full text and all illustrations were not collected in one volume until 2000 The Anthony Roll was originally a set of three separate rolls It exists today in the form of a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane The membranes were of a width of inches 70 cm and a height varying from 31 to inches 79 to 96 cm After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book now known as The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony s but pre dated Pepys binding of the rolls This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated The first three illustrations of the and were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two page spreads The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail Despite this there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls The second roll is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing The three rolls list 58 ships divided into classes based roughly on size and construction Each ship is presented along with its name tonnage crew size and in Anthony s own words the ordenaunce artillery munitions and habillimentes for warre The first roll lists the and one pinnace beginning with the largest ship The second roll lists a hybrid of oar powered and sailing vessels and one Finally the third roll is reserved for and rowbarges both basically smaller versions of galleasses Anthony Anthony was not a trained professional artist The illustrations are described as striking and boldly executed but have few claims to be fine works of art The vessels are for the most part painted according to a standard formula with distinct repetitions even in the more elaborate depictions Anthony s style is signified by a naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern consistent with the abilities of a government official with a decent amateur grasp of form and colour The rolls were all of roughly the same length about 15 feet 4 6 m and would most likely have been presented side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall The focal point of the whole composition is in the second middle roll where the exceptionally well executed painting of the is placed That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the in the first roll which is otherwise reserved for sailing ships This appears to have originally been placed at the beginning of the third roll among the other pinnaces and rowbarges but was moved to achieve more equal lengths In his pursuit of living up to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys something which would have been known to Anthony The lettering framing lines and floral pattern decorations are painted in red or black with the exception of the first three ships of the first roll which also feature gold Most of the illustrations were first sketched with plummet outlines and were then painted over in washes Ship timbers are a light brown that are shaded in the bow and stern to achieve depth decorations and anchors are highlighted with red and green is used for guns Contours are in black and the sea is in shades varying from greyish green to a richer blue The first two rolls were done with roughly the same amount of detail while the lesser rowbarges essentially small galleys were done more hastily The first two ships of the first roll the and the have traces of a grid pattern indicating that they were transferred from a different drawing while the rest are done in freehand Overall the ships follow a formula depending on the type of ship The exceptions are of some of the galleasses and the of the and the the latter both captured from the Scots in 1544 The prominent exception is the placed in the middle of the second roll It is more consistent in type with Mediterranean type galleys than the galleasses and small rowbarges and features a considerable amount of detail not present in the other ships It is the only ship where any crew is visible in this case rowers behind as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing a full skirted armorial and baggy breeches holding a stick or baton as if beating the time of the strokes of the rowers As an historical record the Anthony Roll is in many ways unique It is the only known fully illustrated list of a Tudor period royal navy though the pictures should not be seen as exact depictions drawn from real life For example the lists of guns of the individual ships which are considered to be an accurate record produced by a senior state official are only approximately matched to the paintings The rigging is only roughly accurate and has been described by archaeological project leader of the excavations as a confusing assemblage of and Many details are present but others are missing such as the chain wales the horizontal platforms extending from the sides to which the shrouds the parallel ropes that stabilized the masts were attached to keep them clear of the hull Comparisons with the finds from the salvaged itself have provided an opportunity to compare the accuracy of the records provided in the Roll The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features such as the number of masts and sails When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514 there is a close match proving the illustration to be largely accurate Examination of details in the construction however reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated The heavy stern chasers cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards mounted through gun ports on the just about the waterline would not have been feasible because of the lack of an orlop deck and the steep angle sheer of the ship in this area The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports The accuracy of the has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested The guns in the back of the forecastle have defied explanation but one theory is that they were included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the aiming forwards but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted The list of ammunition small firearms arrows pikes and closely matches the archaeological evidence As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the it has been of central importance for the archaeological project especially in estimating the size of the crew The Anthony Roll provides detailed information about the flags used on the ships According to the Timothy Wilson the flags depicted flying from the ships are the most elaborate source we have for the flags flown on the ships of King Henry VIII being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers shown flying from all ships in varying numbers These feature a red cross on white ground on the nearest the flagpole and a very long tail striped in green and white They all feature gold paint on the red and green and silver paint now oxidized to black on the white This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them Along the railing of all ships most prominently on the large carracks and the there are rows of banners displaying various heraldic designs including the English royal arms one or three of the French arms Saint George s crosses and Henry VIII s monogram HR in gold on blue what appears to be the Tudor rose and the green and white of the The depictions of the flags and banners on the ships are in a heraldic and military sense considered to be roughly accurate but not entirely consistent A kind of system of command among the various vessels is apparent in how flags are displayed on the masts but it does not appear to have been carried through systematically Some of the heraldic designs have been described as unlikely by the 20th century herald but have deemed to at least be plausible by Wilson

great wealth Sir John Brownlow 3rd Baronet chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand palaces being built by others at the time The contemporary if provincial Carolean style was the selected choice of design The new house was fitted with the latest such as for the principal rooms and more significantly with completely separate areas for the staff Successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes yet the fabric and design of the house changed little Following the Custs like many wealthy English families were faced with mounting financial problems and finally in 1984 they donated the house with most of its contents to the which now opens Belton to the public It is in a good state of repair and is visited by many thousands of tourists each year The Brownlow family a dynasty of began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598 In 1609 they acquired the of the of Belton itself from the Pakenham family who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619 The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations a great nephew also called John Brownlow and a great niece Alice Sherard The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16 three years later the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great uncle together with an income of 9 000 per annum about 1 39 million in present day terms and 20 000 in cash equivalent to about 3 08 million now They immediately bought a in the newly fashionable in and decided to build a new country house at Belton Work on the new house began in 1685 The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is although the house has also been attributed to Sir while others believe the design to be so similar to s London that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman The assumption popular today that Winde was the architect is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685 Further evidence is a letter dated 1690 in which Winde recommends a who worked at Belton to another of his patrons Whoever the architect Belton follows closely the design of Clarendon House completed in 1667 This great London demolished c 1683 has been one of the most admired buildings of its era due to its elegant symmetry and confident and common sensical design Sir described Clarendon House as the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner and Belton as much the finest surviving example of its class John and Alice Brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project This dream team was headed by the master who oversaw the project His second in command John Thompson had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on several of the latter s London churches while the chief John Sturges had worked at under The John Warren worked under Stanton at and the fine wrought iron gates and at Belton may be his Thus so competent were the builders of Belton that Winde may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings leaving the interpretation to the on site craftsmen This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block More provincial and less masterful in proportion it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton The late 17th century in England was a time of great progress in design Following the austere years of rule a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the in 1660 exiles and wealthy young men who made the returned home with new ideas often extravagant variations on classical themes This was for England the dawn of the era The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt and Sir were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance inspired styles but also transforming existing older houses Representative of the utilisation of older houses is in where Pratt transformed the medieval but now redundant great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house Employers began to live in fine airy rooms above the ground floor with privacy from their servants who were now confined unless required to specifically delegated areas often the ground and uppermost attic floors This was a period of great social change in British history and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance Belton was designed in the restrained almost inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque The general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical often rectangular houses with a over the central bays This almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses including Belton Later to be known as the style from Carolus the Latin name for the reigning monarch it was popular with the minor and for both their town and country houses until long after Charles II s death Belton is faced with the local with a lighter from for the The H shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late period However by the late 16th century domestic architecture had evolved further than the one room deep ranges of the earlier H plan houses such as The new layout placed rooms back to back creating a house two rooms deep This became known as double pile As at Belton this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other and with the greatest advantage of all greater privacy On the construction side the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one more easily constructed roof thus lowering building costs The plan of the rooms at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of consisting of a dressing room and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central or hall These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest such as a visiting monarch While Belton does have a saloon at its centre of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it The possible reason for this unusual layout is that while the Brownlows possessed great wealth their title was only a and their fortune was barely a century old They would have been regarded as not As a result building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest However the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of coupled with the Brownlows lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King to the newly completed house in 1695 The King occupied the Best bedchamber a large room with an adjoining closet directly above the saloon that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors The layout used followed Roger Pratt s theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate As a consequence of this philosophy the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings with the state rooms in the centre The great staircase designed to be grand and imposing rose to the east side of the house and formed part of the guest s state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second The principal entrance hall reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low containing service rooms The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps The second floor has a matching with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below The very latest innovation was used on both floors The semi basement and storey used the more old fashioned and windows indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi basement and attic floors This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight when not required was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of in Berkshire The contemporary social commentator of the day lauded back stairs of which Belton has two examples and on plan as one of the most important inventions of his day The principal room is the large Marble Hall at the centre of the south front this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or on the north front The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour now the Tapestry Room and the Great Staircase while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings that flank the state centre of the house The main staircase set to one side of the Marble Hall is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed It has a robust plaster work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession William Winde reported in 1690 Bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion the kitchen and the chapel were both large two storied halls rising from the semi basement to the first floor This design not only provided a great and lofty space but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor while their employers would worship from a private gallery complete with fireplace overlooking the chapel on the first floor One of the most features of the house is the and surmounting the roof another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall as is often the case in Europe but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible roof From this vantage point the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house This feature of the house was removed by the architect when he modernised the house in the 18th century It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow Some of Belton s many rooms have been altered over the last 300 years both in use and design One of the principal rooms the the first of the large reception rooms serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance and takes its name from a patterned floor of black and white marble tiles By the time of Belton s conception the was no longer a place for the household to eat but intended as a grand entrance to the house The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings Queens and Emperors from to intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above The room is fully panelled and parts of the panelling contain embellishments attributed to In the early 19th century this room and some others were re modelled by who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate installed new doors The second of the principal reception rooms the opens from the Marble Hall This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens Originally known as the Great Parlour this has always been the chief reception room of the house It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean Edward Goudge The centrepiece of the room is a large carpet made in 1839 for the Either side of the Saloon are two smaller drawing rooms which would originally have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would have taken place in the Marble Hall and Saloon One of these rooms now called the was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor After his death in 1754 it became a Billiard Room until the had it refurnished more than a century later Unusually the floor is painted with the family arms and crest The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested The final large reception room on the first floor is the so named because of the three huge oil paintings by 1636 1695 depicting scenes of birds in courtyards which are fitted into the neo Carolean panelling The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876 when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories The West staircase was originally a service stairs and would have been plainer in decor but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family Either side of the Marble Hall lie the and the which contains a collection of early eighteenth century The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall The stairs rise in three flights around the west north and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house The now the Library has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed first by in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling and again in 1876 when its use was again changed this time to a library The room contains some 6000 volumes a superb example of book collecting over 350 years When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2 300 books Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Leading from the Library is the the former Best Bed Chamber This panelled room was redecorated in 1841 for the visit of Queen widow of when its former function as a state bedroom was resurrected It contains the great canopied style bed in which the Queen slept complete with the royal AR on the bedhead Other rooms on the second floor are mostly bedrooms which include the directly above the Tyrconnel Room with its original hand painted 18th century Chinese wallpaper the directly above the Blue Room and the directly above the School Room so called following its use by King who became the after the Edward visited Belton in the 1930s with his mistress and the was heavily involved in the crisis thanks to his position as the King s Today Belton has a permanent exhibition devoted to that event Another royal visitor also used the room frequently while a cadet at nearby In 1690 Sir John Brownlow was granted permission to enclose an area of 1 000 4 km² to transform into a park with a grant to keep deer There is evidence to suggest that some of this area had been a park since at least 1580 The park was laid out with avenues including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21 400 ash trees 9 500 oak trees and 614 fruit trees It is thought that William Winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the rond points circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate introduced by the landscape gardener By the end of the eighteenth century these formal had been removed and the canal ponds filled in Sir John Brownlow was succeeded at Belton by his brother who was content to permit Brownlow s widow Alice to remain in occupation She spent the remainder of her life at Belton arranging advantageous marriages for her five daughters On her death in 1721 the house passed to her husband s nephew and her son in law Tyrconnel a dilettante of no great intellect was responsible for many of the architectural features which survive in the park and garden Between 1742 and 1751 a series of including a ruin a cascade and a prospect or known as the Belmount Tower were constructed for him When built the tower had two small wings flanking each side since removed owner of Belton House from 1807 1853 commissioned the architect to undertake improvements to the Estate in 1838 Salvin s additions included a estate cottages a hermitage and In 1754 Belton was inherited by the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel s widowed sister Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the unusual fatigues of his office was created Lord Brownlow in 1776 and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation However the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems These included the introduction of and which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted At the beginning of like many other British landowners the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service The offer was accepted and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel s folly building In August 1914 the house and park were used as the assembly point for the before its deployment In 1915 the home depôt and training ground of the were established in the southern part of Belton park The lie of the land there where the passes between the and the mudstone lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the and on the The depôt was closed in 1919 the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920 Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps s stay remains in the park but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church This was the subject for an episode of season 20 episode 01 Belton again saw war service during From 1942 part of the was housed in at the park in a facility named The years following World War I were severely testing for the owners of many great estates The staff both indoor and outdoor which had previously been plentiful essential and cheap were now in short supply Millions of men had left private service to join the army and very few returned Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of the gates of the great country houses Belton House remained relatively untouched during this period largely owing to the failing fortunes of the Brownlow family The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived for only a few months of the year at Belton where they came for the and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and another country house in Ashridge a huge pile had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the It was sold with its art collection and furnishings to pay the arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921 Hence Belton became the Brownlows sole country home Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl s successor his second cousin Adelbert Cust 5th Baron Brownlow In the ensuing period many thousands of country houses of great architectural value were demolished or had whole wings razed to the ground In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all as in addition to the family s problems the house deteriorated to such an extent that in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired and new cornices installed Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of The seventh Baron attempted to retain the house and estate by opening to the public An adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction However the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house garden and some of the contents to the a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties An auction of the contents was held at Belton House by Christie s over three days 30 April 2 May 1984 comprising 1 022 lots The National Trust then purchased at a cost of 8 million worth about 26 million today 1 317 acres 5 3 km² of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the The Trust quickly produced a guide book for the 1984 season and opened to the public A priority was the establishment of a restaurant which would not only augment the estate s income but also encourage people to spend more time at Belton and travel greater distances to visit Though the house its contents and outbuildings were in an adequate state of repair at the time of the gift they have since become part of an ongoing programme of conservation and restoration At the same time the National Trust has introduced new features and attractions such as a silver exhibition which displays a collection of silver amassed by the Brownlow family dating from 1698 Further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location and from licensing the Marble Hall for civil weddings The house features in the BBC s 1988 adaptation of and also as Rosings Park in the s 1995 television version of It was visited by 422 682 people during 2018 Until its acceptance by the National Trust Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line The owners of Belton are buried in the village of s church close to the house Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer 1555 1638 and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow 1899 1978 The owners of Belton House have been

exhibiting all the stateliness for which the period referred to was remarkable with a suite of apartments both large and lofty The amplitude of its dimensions indicate a princely residence An inventory taken in 1634 after Zouche s death listed the library as having 250 books and a collection of mathematical instruments and revealed that the maids chamber was of a very high standard James

Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for 9 500 to Sir Robert Henley In 1673 it was the property of his son Sir John Cope purchased the property in 1699 and his descendants occupied the premises until 1935 The Cope family shortened the wings on the south side in 1703 converted most of the chapel to a drawing room and introduced a mezzanine on the west side during the 18th century They were responsible for much of the interior with significant renovation work done in the 19th century and in 1920 After his victory over Napoleon the was offered his choice of house by Parliament he visited Bramshill but in

Home Affairs Select Committee by 1989 it was in a poor state of repair In July 2013 the Home Office placed the house and estate on the market for 25 million It was sold to the heritage property developers City Country in August 2014 In 2018 the house with a reduced estate of about 90 acres was put back on the market with a guide price of 10 million The 15 bedroom 56 974 square feet 5 293 1 m Bramshill House is one of the largest and most important Jacobean mansions in England described as one of the glories of English architecture by the historians and The architecture of the three storey building was inspired by the Italian Renaissance and was executed mainly by German builders It is approximately 140 feet 43 m in length The design is traditionally attributed to the architect although no records remain to confirm the attribution The building stands on the edge of a plateau overlooking the park to the south The plan of the house is unusual partly because of its incorporation of the earlier building it extends at right angles to the primary southern façade The elevations are symmetrical facing outwards but the interior court is narrow and projecting wings lie at either end of the eastern and western sides Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east There are three vaulted cellars to the west The house is built of red brick laid in dressed with stone with at the corners of the wings Stone dressings are featured on numerous large windows An open carved surmounts the building The roof consists of red tiles and there are large on the west side The are rectangular The north façade has three bays separated by windows and features a typical of early 17th century houses with a central arched entrance to accommodate coaches The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I There are small at either side of the gable Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house The southern façade was described by as among the most fanciful pieces of Jacobean design in England It is three storeys high and features three sets of three bays in either wing with five inner sections The outer two of the inner sections feature eight angular windows aligned in rows of four on the first two floors and then a row of four windows on the top floor The inner two sections have the same layout on the first and top floors with eight windows aligned in rows of four on the first floor and four windows on the top floor but the ground floor features two arches which form part of the central loggia The stone central bay 20 feet 6 1 m wide is emphasised by superimposed double decorated pilasters on all floors and the central archway of the loggia in the and orders surmounted by a florid perforated pediment In addition there is an on the first floor above the main entrance An important difference from the other sides of this building is a terrace 25 feet 7 6 m in width between the projecting wings a kind of architectural foreground to the garden The terrace is bounded by a 3 foot 3 inch high 0 99 m The arcade on the terrace of the southern front is a good example of Italian domestic architecture used in villas The and ornamented together with the simple capitals of the columns indicate the Doric order but are light enough to be Ionic The south entrance was the model for Darlington the in New Jersey US built between 1901 and 1907 The east façade is the longest about 124 feet 38 m wide and two storeys high It features four full height angular bays with two windows between while its upper walls have two arches set within a rectangular panel On this side there is a Terrace with a lawn as well as two openings at the side on either wing of the house The southernmost arcaded opening contains a bench with eight arches and has three tables one of which is older and octagonal Carved in the wall at the side is a consisting of four squares each depicting an animal a lion an elephant a wild boar and a camel The west façade dates to the 18th century and is the only one with multiple gables the windows on the ground floor are sashed Two of the rooms have large tapestries on their walls depicting historical figures and scenes Those in the drawing room contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by who supervised the work in Brussels These tapestries were initially made for Zouche s brother diplomat but in the end he rejected them for another set how the first set came to Bramshill is not known Rubens s sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in Munich The west section of the ground floor contains the former dining room and kitchen The openings in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope uncovering an original doorway with a four centred pointed arch Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance on the north side of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard and several doorways remain in the kitchen and housekeeping areas The Great Hall to which an arcaded porch gives direct access retains the basic design of the original construction It has a and a Jacobean stone screen 13 feet 4 0 m high decorated with 92 shields Resident families emblazoned the shields with the of ancestors and family members The of the screen has a double row of 40 sculptured shields and has a depth of 2 feet 6 inches 0 76 m Beyond the dais double doors lead into the Terrace Hall at the foot of the staircase Across from this is the former dining room containing a large tapestry believed to have been made by an English artist representing forest scenery in very subdued colours During the time of the Cope family in the 1880s the kitchen near the south hall was used as a dairy The kitchen and the adjoining room had back to back fireplaces The drawing room containing four bay windows of different sizes is panelled with oak for its entire height of about 16 feet 4 9 m One of the upper panels surmounted by its Corinthian entablature is a frieze depicting a and each with foliage and blossoms One of the lower panels part of the in the same room has a section of projecting

by one of the great Italian architects of 16th century It is two storeys in height the lower being Doric and the upper Ionic The distribution of the members is regular and the shafts of the columns are variegated The upper compartment of the chimneypiece is composed of separate pieces of the same diversified material and the frieze of the upper order also consists of coloured marble in the centre The fireplace is 6 feet 1 8 m wide and 4 feet 8 inches 1 42 m high and retains the ancient used for burning wood These are large and well adorned particularly in the lower part The ceilings of the drawing room and library are the most elaborate in the house The plaster frieze in the library also displays fine workmanship 1 foot 7 inches 0 48 m wide it is designed in a striking arabesque pattern with an evident influence In the 1880s the library had a collection of 5 000 volumes about half the number the Cope family owned at the time The standards and balusters of the stairs on the north side of the hall came from and probably date to the mid 17th century although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid 16th century The walls above the stairs and on the first floor landing contain some very large paintings including several portraits Beyond the staircase are the state rooms and what was known as the Wrought Room The room has an ornamental ceiling with a Renaissance chimneypiece Two of the bedrooms the two White Rooms were originally connected to what was called the Flower de luce Room but the doors have been boarded up The Long Gallery fills the first floor of the northern range 126 5 feet 38 6 m long and with a richly decorated ceiling and a complex wooden chimneypiece it formerly contained a very curious collection of portraits of distinguished characters Also on the first floor is the Chapel Drawing Room in the south wing connected to the Drawing Room The Copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel which is entered through it The current chapel has an altar with paintings of the Virgin Mary St Stephen St Mary Magdalene and St John the Evangelist by Alexander Rowan and dated by Pevsner to about 1840 The tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier in the early 19th century it had hung in the Red Drawing Room When the chapel ceiling was restored by Sir William Cope it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood The large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel The house is set in 262 acres 106 ha of grounds which include an 18 acre 7 3 ha lake north of the house The grounds form part of a that received a Grade II listing in 1984 this was subsequently upgraded to Grade I in September 2017 Under this designation are the 25 acres 10 ha of early 17th century formal gardens near the house the wider 490 acre 200 ha medieval park landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century with 250 acres 100 ha of woodland and buildings including an icehouse and a known as Conduit House Parts of the park have been used for commercial softwood production since the 19th century To the west of the house is Peatmoor Copse and to the east Bramshill Forest and the grounds contained what was known as the Green Court and the Flower Garden at the time of William Henry Cope in the 1880s The Grade I listed gatehouse dates to the time of the Foxleys The fir trees in the grounds are reputed to have been planted as a memento of his former home by James I who brought them from Scotland The formal gardens were first laid out by Edward la Zouche a horticulturist Sir John Cope redesigned the gardens and continued the planting of trees in the park At the close of the 18th century the grounds were re landscaped to be less formal and some areas in the south were returned to parkland Bramshill Park was conceived as a hunting box for Henry Frederick and became a popular estate for hunting On 24 July 1621 while hunting in the park accidentally shot and killed one of the gamekeepers with his crossbow An inquiry cleared him of murder Another notable clergyman hunter who frequented Bramshill was rector of Eversley who hunted fox and deer and collected butterflies there and frequently took his family and friends Kingsley was reportedly especially enamoured of the fir trees which he considered a source of constant delight fondly naming them James the First s gnarled giants In the 19th century Sir John Cope a friend of Kingsley s was known as a supporter of the fox hunt and especially as a breeder of fox hounds The opening of the season at Bramshill in the late 1840s was noted in the British hunting press The main avenue approaches from the southwest through an arched gateway formed by two Grade II listed early 19th century lodges before crossing the Broad Water formed by the River Hart by a Grade I listed early 19th century bridge with two arches There are separate listings for other structures near the house including the Grade I listed early 17th century triple arched gateway on the route to to the northeast of the house Grade I listed early 17th century boundary walls and turrets to the south and west Grade II listed boundary walls and gate piers to the west including the kitchen garden Grade I listed garden walls and gateways to the north and east and the Grade II listed late 18th century stable block to the north Bramshill has been cited as one of the most houses in England According to one UK police officer who worked at the college 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified although another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously They include a Grey Lady one story suggests that her husband a religious dissenter was beheaded in the 17th century and a Green Man a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806 according to the journalist P Lal or threw himself off a cliff near according to the author Penny Legg The Green Man dressed as his name suggests reportedly manifests near the lake as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace the library and the chapel Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance with a sad tear stained face and golden hair and smelling of the Lal argues that she has reddish brown hair and wears a grey sleeveless robe The Grey Lady s husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room the child has supposedly been heard crying and attempts to hold visitors hands Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child s mother A lady dressed in the style of and a knight in armour are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th century dress and by that of a nun A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century In addition Bramshill House was cited by the historian as a possible location for the a ghost story associated with several English country mansions This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of on her wedding night In the case of Bramshill House the story has it that this happened at Christmas time and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand the chest is on display in the entrance hall The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope s daughter Anne who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire An alternative claim is that she was Genevre Orsini who was married in 1727 and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest In his monograph on the house the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original which had been proved large enough by a woman of comely proportions who had tested it by lying down in it but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope s widow in 1812 The ghost of the bride is referred to as the White Lady and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room According to Legg asked to be moved to another room during a stay there in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night An old man with a grey beard thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest 
 included the chapel at the and the in Paris and extensions to the near Born in 1519 in Florence to an Italian father and a French mother was a daughter of both the and the She grew up in Florence and Rome under the wing of the popes and In 1533 at the age of fourteen she left Italy and married the second son of and of France On doing so she entered the greatest Renaissance court in northern Europe King Francis set his daughter in law an example of kingship and artistic patronage that she never forgot She witnessed his huge architectural schemes at and She saw Italian and French craftsmen at work together forging the style that became known as the first Francis died in 1547 and Catherine became queen consort of France But it wasn t until her husband King Henry s death in 1559 when she found herself at forty the effective ruler of France that Catherine came into her own as a patron of architecture Over the next three decades she launched a series of costly building projects aimed at enhancing the grandeur of the monarchy During the same period however religious civil war gripped the country and brought the prestige of the monarchy to a dangerously low ebb Catherine loved to supervise each project personally The architects of the day dedicated books to her knowing that she would read them Though she spent colossal sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces little remains of Catherine s investment today one column a few fragments in the corner of the Tuileries gardens an empty tomb at Saint Denis The sculptures she commissioned for the Valois chapel are lost or scattered often damaged or incomplete in museums and churches Catherine de Medici s reputation as a sponsor of buildings rests instead on the designs and treatises of her architects These testify to the vitality of French architecture under her patronage Historians often assume that Catherine s love for the arts stemmed from her heritage As the daughter of the Medici suggests French art historian Jean Pierre Babelon she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died Born in Florence in 1519 Catherine lived at the built by to designs by After moving to Rome in 1530 she lived surrounded by classical and Renaissance treasures at another Medici palace now called the There she watched the leading artists and architects of the day at work in the city When she later commissioned buildings herself in France Catherine often turned to Italian models She based the on the in Florence and she originally planned the Hotel de la Reine with the in mind Catherine however left Italy in 1533 at the age of fourteen and married the second son of King Though she kept in touch with her native Florence her taste matured at the royal court of France Her father in law impressed Catherine deeply as an example of what a monarch should be She later copied Francis policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone whatever the cost His lavish building projects inspired her own Francis was a compulsive builder He began extension works at the added a wing to the old castle at and built the vast château of which he showed off to the emperor in 1539 He also transformed the lodge at into one of the great palaces of Europe a project that continued under Artists such as and worked on the interior alongside French craftsmen This meeting of Italian and French patronage bred an original style later known as the first Featuring and high relief in the shape of parchment or curled leather it became the dominant decorative fashion in France in the second half of the sixteenth century Catherine later herself employed Primaticcio to design her Valois chapel She also patronised French talent such as the architects and and the sculptor The death of Henry II from wounds in 1559 changed Catherine s life From that day she wore black and took as her emblem a broken lance She turned her widowhood into a political force that validated her authority during the reigns of her three weak sons She also became intent on immortalizing her sorrow at the death of her husband She had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings She commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry as the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel In 1562 a long poem by Nicolas Houël likened Catherine to who had built the at one of the as a tomb for her dead husband Artemesia had also acted as regent for her children Houël laid stress on Artemesia s devotion to architecture In his dedication to he told Catherine In memory of Henry II Catherine decided to add a new chapel to the where the kings of France were traditionally buried As the centrepiece of this circular chapel sometimes known as the Valois she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself The design of this tomb should be understood in the context of its planned setting The plan was to integrate the tomb s effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel creating a vast spatial composition Catherine s approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition To lead the Valois chapel project Catherine chose who had worked for Henry at Fontainebleau Primaticcio designed the chapel as a round building crowned by a dome to be joined to the north of the basilica The interior and exterior of the chapel were to be decorated with columns and in coloured marble The building would contain six other chapels circling the tomb of Henry and Catherine Primaticcio s circular design solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and who had built previous royal tombs Whereas de l Orme had designed the tomb of Francis I to be viewed only from the front or the side Primaticcio s design allowed the tomb to be viewed from all angles Art historian Henri Zerner has called the plan a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda s celestial space Work on the chapel began in 1563 and continued over the next two decades Primaticcio died in 1570 and the architect took over the project two years later After Bullant s death in 1578 led the work The building was abandoned in 1585 Over two hundred years later in 1793 a mob tossed Catherine and Henry s bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens Several of the monuments built for the Valois chapel have survived These include the tomb of Catherine and Henry in Zerner s view the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance Primaticcio himself designed its structure which eliminated the traditional and kept ornamentation to a minimum The sculptor who had provided statues for the tomb of Francis I carved the tomb s two sets of effigies which represented death below and eternal life above The king and queen cast in bronze kneel in prayer on a marble canopy supported by twelve marble columns Their poses echo those on the nearby tombs of and Pilon s feel for the material however invests his statues with a greater sense of movement Before they were destroyed in the Revolution the remains of the king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below Catherine s effigy suggests sleep rather than death while Henry is posed strikingly with his head thrown back From 1583 Pilon also sculpted two later of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes In this case he portrays Catherine realistically with a double chin These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel Pilon s four bronze statues of the stand at the corners of the tomb Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall work on the monument for the heart of Francis I In the 1580s Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb Among these the fragmentary now in the Louvre was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel This work owes a clear debt to who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine s father at the in Florence Pilon s statue of now stands in the church of St Jean and St François In art historian Anthony Blunt s view it marks a departure from the tension of and almost foreshadows the Pilon had by this time developed a freer style of sculpture than previously seen in France Earlier French sculpture seems to have influenced him less than Primaticcio s decorations at Fontainebleau the work of his predecessor for example is more linear and classical Pilon openly depicts extreme emotion in his work sometimes to the point of the grotesque His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the Catherine s earliest building project was the château of near Paris which Henry II gave her in 1556 three years before his death The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase and two wings with a at each end Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played an early form of For this commission Philibert de l Orme built her a He set it on a base made to look like natural rock from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived The château ceased to be used as a royal residence after 1640 and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798 After the death of Henry II Catherine abandoned the palace of the where Henry had lain after a lance fatally pierced his eye and brain in a To replace the Tournelles she decided in 1563 to build herself a new Paris residence on the site of some old tile kilns or The site was close to the congested Louvre where she kept her household The grounds extended along the banks of the and afforded a view of the countryside to the south and west The was the first palace that Catherine had planned from the ground up It was to grow into the largest royal building project of the last quarter of the sixteenth century in western Europe Her massive building schemes would have transformed western Paris as seen from the river into a monumental complex To design the new palace Catherine brought back from disgrace This arrogant genius had been sacked as superintendent of royal buildings at the end of reign after making too many enemies De l Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture but his ideas are not fully known It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles De l Orme is said to have taught France the classical style lucid rational and regular He notes however that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to later work and to a less classical style of architecture For the of Catherine s palace de l Orme chose the which he considered a feminine form Catherine de Medici was closely involved in planning and supervising the building De l Orme records for example that she told him to take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain She also insisted on large panels between the to make room for inscriptions Only a part of de l Orme s scheme was ever built the lower section of a central pavilion containing an oval staircase and a wing on either side Though work on de l Orme s design was abandoned in 1572 two years after his death it is nonetheless held in high regard According to Thomson The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux Arts Paris and the Château de la Punta in show that the columns pilasters dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture De l Orme s original plans have not survived however has left us a set of plans for the Tuileries One engraving shows a grandiose palace with three courts and two oval halls This design is atypical of de l Orme s style and so is likely to have been du Cerceau s own proposal or his son Baptiste s It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau s courtyards were Catherine de Medici s idea She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments Du Cerceau s drawings reveal that before he published them in 1576 Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine Only the ground floor of the first section the was completed in her lifetime It was left to who ruled from 1589 to 1610 to add the second floor and the that finally linked the two palaces After de l Orme died in 1570 Catherine abandoned his design for a freestanding house with courtyards To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river This was built in a less experimental style by Bullant attached columns to his pavilion as advocated in his 1564 book on the to mark proportion Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l Orme s departures from the style of Roman monuments Despite its unfinished state Catherine often visited the palace She held banquets and festivities there and loved to walk in the gardens According to the French military leader it was in the Tuileries gardens that she planned the in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted They included canals fountains and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter In 1573 Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the to her son the duke of Anjou later later added to the Tuileries but was to dismantle sections of the palace The set fire to the remainder in 1871 Twelve years later the ruins were demolished and then sold off The palace of south east of Paris was another of Catherine s unfinished projects She bought this building on which Philibert de l Orme had worked from the heirs of after the latter s death in 1560 She then commissioned de l Orme to finish the work he had begun there Drawings by in the may shed light on Catherine s intentions for Saint Maur They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling the size of the next to the main block of the house The house was to stay as one storey with a flat roof and That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side De l Orme died in 1570 in 1575 an unknown architect took over at Saint Maur The new man proposed to heighten the pavilions on the garden side and top them with pitched roofs He also planned two more arches over de l Orme s terrace which joined the pavilions on the garden side In historian R J Knecht s view the scheme would have given this part of the house a colossal even grotesque The work was only partly carried out and the house was never fit for Catherine to live in The Château de Saint Maur still in the possession of the Condé family was nationalised during the emptied of its contents and its terrains divided up among real estate speculators The structure was demolished for the value of its materials virtually nothing remains After de l Orme s death Jean Bullant replaced him as Catherine s chief architect In 1572 Catherine commissioned Bullant to build a new home for her within the Paris city walls She had outgrown her apartments at the Louvre and needed more room for her swelling household To make space for the new scheme and its gardens she had an entire area of Paris demolished The new palace was known in Catherine s time as the Hôtel de la Reine and later as the Hôtel de Soissons Engravings made by in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the Hôtel de la Reine possessed a central wing a courtyard and gardens The walled gardens of the hôtel included an a lake with a water jet and long avenues of trees Catherine also installed an that could be dismantled in winter The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant s death in 1582 The building was demolished in the 1760s All that remains of the Hôtel de la Reine today is a single column known as the Colonne de l Horoscope or which stood in the courtyard It can be seen next to the domed Catherine s biographer Leonie Frieda has called it a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power In 1576 Catherine decided to enlarge her château of near Blois On Henry II s death she had demanded this property from Henry s mistress She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane instead of to her In return she gave Diane the less prized When Diane arrived at Chaumont she found signs of the occult such as drawn on the floor She quickly withdrew to her château of and never set foot in Chaumont again Diane had carried out major works at Chenonceau such as de l Orme s bridge over the Now Catherine set out to efface or outdo her former rival s work She lavished vast sums on the house and built two galleries on the extension over the bridge The architect was almost certainly Bullant The decorations show the fantasy of his late style Catherine loved gardens and often conducted business in them At Chenonceau she added waterfalls and laid out three parks and planted trees for made drawings of a grandiose scheme for Chenonceau A lower court leads to a forecourt of semicircular joined to two halls that flank the original house These drawings may not be a reliable record of Bullant s plans Du Cerceau sometimes inserted in his book designs embodying ideas which he himself would have liked to see carried out rather than those of the actual designer of the building in question Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a favourite architect of Catherine s Like Bullant he became a more fantastical designer with time Nothing he built himself however has survived He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day including Saint Maur the Tuileries and Chenonceau In 1576 and 1579 he produced the two volume a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered Catherine spent ruinous sums of money on buildings at a time of plague famine and economic hardship in France As the country slipped deeper into anarchy her plans grew ever more ambitious Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its was in steep decline The popular view condemned Catherine s building schemes as obscenely extravagant This was especially true in Paris where the was often asked to contribute to her costs captured the mood in a poem Ronsard was in many ways proved correct The death of Catherine s beloved son in 1589 a few months after her own brought the Valois dynasty to an end Precious little of Catherine s grand building work has survived 
 is a ruined building on the coast of Despite its name it is in the of not the adjoining village of and was probably not a The building stood on a raised mound or eye on the seaward end of the coastal marshes less than 200 m 220 yd from the sea and just to the north of the current channel of the where it turns to run parallel to the shoreline It consisted of two rectangular rooms of unequal size and appears to be intact in a 1586 map but is shown as ruins in later charts Only the foundations and part of a wall still remain Three investigations between 1998 and 2005 provided more detail of the construction and showed two distinct periods of active use Although it is described as a chapel on several maps there is no documentary or archaeological evidence to suggest that it had any religious function A small probably used for iron is the only evidence of a specific activity on the site Much of the structural material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney The surviving ruins are protected as a and because of their historical importance but there is no active management The ever present threat from the encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven s course through the marshes and lead to the loss of the ruins The Blakeney Chapel ruins consist of an east west rectangular structure S1 18 m 7 m 59 ft 23 ft in size with a smaller rectangular building S2 13 m 5 m 43 ft 16 ft built onto the southern side of the main room Most of the structure is buried only a 6 m 20 ft length of a and mortar wall being exposed to a height of 0 3 m 1 ft prior to the excavation of 2004 05 The ruins stand on the highest point of Blakeney Eye at about 2 m 7 ft above sea level The Eye is a sandy mound in the that is located inside the sea wall at the point where the turns westward towards the sheltered inlet of Cley Eye is a similar raised area on the east bank of the river Despite the name Blakeney Eye like most of the northern part of the marshes in this area is actually part of the parish of Cley next the Sea The land on which the building stands was in the possession of the until its purchase by banker in 1912 Rothschild gave the property to the which has managed it since There is no public access to the site The ruins are protected as a and because of their historical importance These listings do not cover the land around them but the whole of the marsh forms part of the 7 700 hectare 19 000 acre SSSI because of its internationally important wildlife value The SSSI is now additionally protected through SPA and listings and is part of the AONB The building was first shown on a 1586 map of the Blakeney and Cley area apparently drawn to be used in evidence in a legal case regarding the rights to the outcome of which is unknown The original map disappeared in the 19th century but a number of copies still exist In this map the building on the Eye is shown as intact and roofed but it has no name A map by the Cranefields from 1769 has the building as Eye House but by 1797 William Faden s map of Norfolk shows the chapel ruins a description that was then consistently used from the 19th century onwards Some maps including Faden s show a second ruined chapel across the Glaven on Cley Eye but no other documentation exists for that building The medieval churches of and and the now ruined Blakeney were not the first religious buildings in the area An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Snitterley was a former name for Blakeney the current name first appearing in 1340 but the 11th century church s location is unknown and there is no reason to think that it is on the site of the chapel An anonymous booklet on Blakeney published in 1929 states that there was a on the marshes served by a from the Convent but the document on which this seems to be based a Calendar of dated 20 April 1343 simply notes that a local hermit was given permission to seek in divers parts of the realms There is no evidence of a dedication of any religious building on the marshes and no mention of a chapel in any surviving medieval documents The first investigation of the chapel ruins supported by the National Trust was conducted by the local history group in the winter of 1998 99 This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation so it relied on height measurements and and sampling The area surveyed was 100 m long and 40 m wide 109 yd by 44 yd The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel but did show an unexpected linear anomaly related to buried ironwork from defences The resistivity survey clearly showed the larger room but barely detected the smaller suggesting that it had less substantial foundations was probably less well constructed and possibly later in date Plans for a realignment of the Glaven channel meant that the Eye would be left unprotected to the north of the river and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004 05 The surveyed area covered 10 ha 25 acre significantly more than the 0 4 ha 1 acre of the 1998 investigations 50 trenches were excavated in a outside the buildings each 50 m long and 1 80 m wide 194 by 5 9 ft and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches The geology was investigated with eight and geophysics magnetometry and were used to locate subsurface anomalies The major excavation of the site in the winter of 2004 05 concentrated on the building and a 10 m 33 ft zone surrounding it The results indicated that there were a number of phases of occupation The remains of the building were reburied after excavation so nothing is now visible at the surface The earliest evidence of permanent occupation is a series of ditches of 11th or 12th century date which are believed to have formed an enclosure the south east corner of which lies below the chapel Evidence for any buildings within the enclosure has either been lost to the Glaven or is buried outside the survey area Few finds were associated with the ditches although some fragments of or earlier pottery and three were found nearby As elsewhere on the site there is little evidence to link the old pottery to its location when found By the time of the construction of the main building some time in the 14th century the ditches had filled with sand A small was built at ground level shortly before or during the erection of S1 It appears to have had fairly light use but the presence of suggests that it was intended for iron perhaps by a There was evidence for a number of small fires elsewhere in S1 at a similar date to the hearth but whether they were related to the smelting is unknown At this time hearths could not melt metallic iron but produced a bloom a mixture of iron and slag which could be converted to by repeated heating and hammering Another even earlier smelting hearth is known from 17 km 10 mi further east on the Norfolk coast The main in this area is the iron rich local The larger north building was built without deep foundation trenches but was nevertheless a solid well built flint and mortar construction The building had substantial time and money spent on it in the opinion of the principal archaeologist The flints were selected to decrease in size as the walls rose and the internal corners were decorated with blocks set as Seashells were recovered with a distribution suggesting that they were once part of the fabric of the building as strengthening for the mortar There were entrances in the west and northeast walls and some evidence that there were once windows in the northwest and south walls The floor was compacted soil and the original roof material is unknown but the presence of a few glazed floor tiles and of a somewhat later date is consistent with a higher status appearance There was no internal wall at this date but there may have been an external wooden extension to the southwest corner The medieval building was eventually abandoned and much of the structural material was taken for reuse in Blakeney and Cley villages A stone archway in Cley is traditionally believed to have come from the chapel and would fit the western entrance although it could have been brought from elsewhere such as the ruined Blakeney friary The chapel building was deserted around 1600 but whether the collapse of its east end was the cause or a consequence of its disuse is unknown The main building seems to have suffered a major fire at some stage and no wooden structures have been found The site was flooded at least three times subsequent to the building s collapse At some stage part of the western wall was lost the steep slope where it stood suggesting that it may have been taken by the sea Most of the pottery found within the larger room was 14th to 16th century nearly a third of which was imported from the continent reflecting the Glaven ports importance in international trade at this time The pottery appeared to be mainly domestic in nature including jugs and cooking vessels The 17th century room S2 used the south wall of the existing structure as its own north wall and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1 although the standard of the work was poorer The new room had a double fireplace but there was no evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths Limestone blocks identical to the quoins in S1 were used as structural and decorative features in the fireplace In addition to the pantiles taken from S1 there were slate roof tiles Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear At the same time that S2 was built a dividing wall again of inferior quality was built across S1 to create a western room There were no molehills within the smaller building which had suggested that unlike its neighbour it has a buried solid floor and this was confirmed by excavation This had a floor originally made of mortar relaid at least once but then covered with a layer of flint suggesting that it was a working area The old hearth was not covered so it may have still been used A new fireplace was also added apparently of a domestic design although the context makes that function improbable A well marked track led southwest down the slope from S1 and a large was close to the path It has been suggested that a clean pit north of S1 was a well with above the saltwater below a phenomenon known from and elsewhere on the Norfolk coast There is only limited evidence for use after the 17th century desertion including a 19th century and some glassware A wartime fence ran through the ruins and was detected by excavation and magnetometry Other modern finds included a bullets and other small metal objects Blakeney Eye has a long history of occupation with many finds from the but few from or dates although a gold was a rare and significant 6th century find Animal and plant finds showed that both domesticated species such as and locally available prey such as were eaten rabbit and remains may reflect the use of fur from these mammals Evidence of processing and storage is difficult to date but may be medieval The buildings were abandoned during the 17th century and their uses which may have been varied over the long period of occupation remain unknown The east west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would not preclude religious use but there is no other evidence archaeological or documentary to support that possibility The limited number of finds even of material which could not have been reused have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time Other plausible uses have been suggested such as a or a house but again there is nothing to support these speculations Realignment of the River Glaven means the ruins are now to the north of the river embankment and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion since the advancing will no longer be swept away by the stream The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south and then lost to the sea perhaps within 20 30 years The ridge of shingle runs west from along the Norfolk coast before becoming a spit extending into the sea at Blakeney Saltmarshes can develop behind the ridge but the sea attacks the spit through tidal and storm action The amount of shingle moved by a single storm can be spectacular the spit has sometimes been breached becoming an island for a time and this may happen again The northernmost part of Snitterley village was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages probably due to a storm In the last two hundred years the maps have been accurate enough for the distance from the ruins to the sea to be measured The 400 m 440 yd in 1817 had become 320 m 350 yd by 1835 275 m 300 yd in 1907 and 195 m 215 yd by the end of the 20th century The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1 m 1 yd per year and several raised islands or eyes have already been lost to the sea as the beach has rolled over the saltmarsh Landward movement of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven itself excavated in 1922 because an earlier more northerly course was overwhelmed between Blakeney and Cley was becoming blocked increasingly often This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important freshwater marshes The considered a number of remedial options Attempting to hold back the shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line and work to realign a 550 m 600 yd stretch of river 200 m 220 yd further south was completed in 2007 at a cost of about 1 5 million is likely to be the long term solution to rising sea levels along much of the North Norfolk coast It has already been implemented at other important sites like

received a new charter for the entire land grant from in 1688 Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper his wife Margaret and his daughter Katherine the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine s son in 1719 Under Lord Fairfax s ownership the Cacapon River Valley was predominantly inhabited by English speaking settlers as early as the late 1730s The majority of these settlers had come from and many of whom were either or former Quakers who were attracted to the and denominations The established the oldest extant churches in Hampshire County After the end of the Baptist preachers continued their attempt to gain a foothold in what is now the region During the Baptists early growth in Hampshire County the best known Baptist ministers were John Monroe 1750 1824 and Benjamin Stone 1743 1842 Monroe preached at the North River Crooked Run and Patterson s Creek churches during the early 19th century According to historians and in 1897 Monroe was a minister for who were adherent to a strict interpretation of the theology of the Ketocton Association Monroe probably established a Baptist church on the site of the present day Capon Chapel where he is buried in the church s cemetery However other sources claim that a Baptist congregation began gathering at the Capon Chapel site as early as 1756 Increased settlement and the arrival of other religious denominations in the Cacapon River Valley were further facilitated following the completion of the in the 1830s which connected with A small community began to develop near the turnpike s Cacapon River crossing 2 01 miles 3 23 km north of Capon Chapel s present day location The community later became the town of Capon Bridge The land on which Capon Chapel was built belonged to William C Nixon 1789 1869 a member of the Nixon s mother

documentary evidence to support this claim The first documented mention of a church at the Capon Chapel site was in March 1852 when Joseph Pugh allocated 88 and one half poles or approximately 0 55 acres 2 200 m to three trustees David Pugh another David Pugh and Robert Pugh The Pugh family which was of Welsh descent were early settlers in the Cacapon River Valley and were one of the families that came from Wales through Pennsylvania in the late 17th century The grant s deed told the trustees to conceive a Graveyard and for a house for the Public Worship of Almighty God for the use of all orthodox Christians and specified that the land was only to be used for religious worship and for no other purpose The deed further stipulated that inheritors of the land had to be Pugh s descendants During the church s early years no denomination was the exclusive owner or occupant of Capon Chapel which indicates that the church was probably utilized as a union church for worship by any Christian denomination Since no single denomination oversaw the church during this early period few records of its early activities and construction exist Later records suggest that Capon Chapel was used as a place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century While it remains unclear why or how the church became associated with the Baptists its use by the denomination is possibly associated with the a Protestant revival movement during the early to mid 19th century that gained momentum throughout the United States According to the December 1904 issue of the Baptist Little Cacapon Church contributed one dollar to the general fund of Capon Chapel demonstrating that the Baptist community still continued to operate from or associate with the church in 1904 In addition to the Baptist faith Methodists started coming to the Cacapon River Valley during the latter half of the 18th century traveled through the Capon Bridge area in 1781 In 1890 the established its presence in the Capon Bridge area under the leadership of G O Homan According to Maxwell and Swisher the Capon Bridge consisted of the following places in 1897 Capon Bridge Green Mound Park s Hollow Sandy Ridge and Capon Chapel Capon Chapel was not commonly used as a Baptist place of worship by the early 20th century and developed into a permanent stop along the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit which

the interior of the church when it was electrified around 1930 and further electrical updates were made in 2011 The church s perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s and its wide plank floors were sanded and re lacquered Around 1990 the Stewart Iron Works fence and gate were restored by In 2008 following surveys of historic properties throughout the county the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission embarked upon an initiative to place structures and districts on the The county received funding for the surveys from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History Capon Chapel was one of the first of eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register The other seven properties were and According to the Hampshire County Commission s compliance officer Charles Baker places of worship were not typically selected for inclusion in the register however Capon Chapel and Old Pine Church were exceptions because both started out as meeting houses Capon Chapel is among the earliest existing log churches in Hampshire County along with and Old Pine Church Capon Chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12 2012 in recognition of its representation of the rural religious architecture of

placed on small stone foundations The gravestones of prominent local leaders are more ornate in character including that of Captain David Pugh and his family who are buried under a large that lists the names of his three wives and their respective children Nixon s gravestone is deteriorating due to advanced weathering it is made of limestone and contains a carving of an open book Following the purchase of a rectangular land tract around 1990 the cemetery was expanded on the east side This section of the cemetery is excluded from the church s historically recognized boundaries as it was not associated with the church during the period of its greatest significance The cemetery perimeter is lined on three sides by a cast wrought iron fence accessible by a gate 3 feet 0 91 m in width at its

has no having its various chambers built around the outer defensive walls and inner courts Its corners and entrance are marked by towers and topped by Its structure details and situation in an artificial watery landscape indicate that display was an important aspect of the castle s design as well as defence It was the home of the family and the centre of the of Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of Dalyngrigges until their line became extinct when the castle passed by marriage to the Lewknor family During the Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the and when of the became king in 1483 a force was despatched to Bodiam Castle It is unrecorded whether the siege went ahead but it is thought that Bodiam was surrendered without much resistance The castle was confiscated but returned to the Lewknors when of the House of Lancaster became king in 1485 Descendants of the Lewknors owned the castle until at least the 16th century By the start of the in 1641 Bodiam Castle was in the possession of He supported the cause and sold the castle to help pay fines levied against him by Parliament The castle was subsequently dismantled and was left as a picturesque ruin until its purchase by in 1829 Under his auspices the castle was partially restored before being sold to and later to both of whom undertook further restoration work The castle is protected as a Grade I and It has been owned by since 1925 donated by Lord Curzon on his death and is open to the public Edward Dalyngrigge was a younger son and thus deprived of his father s estates through the practice of hence he had to make his own fortunes By 1378 he owned the of by marrying into a land owning family From 1379 to 1388 Dalyngrigge was a for Sussex and one of the most influential people in the county By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate build a castle the had been fought between England and France for nearly 50 years reigned 1327 1377 pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of and Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with and son of Edward III After fighting under the Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100 000 as a mercenary from pillage and plunder It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle he returned to England in 1377 The ensured peace for two years but after it expired fighting resumed between England and France In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by During the war England and France struggled for control of the with raids on both coasts With the renewed hostilities voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England s south coast and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion There was internal unrest as well as external threats and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the of 1381 The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a weekly market and an annual fair to be held In 1385 a fleet of 1 200 ships variously barges and galleys gathered across the English Channel at Flanders the population of southern England was in a state of panic Later in the year Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a his Dalyngrigge s licence from Richard II permitted him to refortify his existing manor house but instead he chose a fresh site to build a castle on Construction was completed in one phase and most of the castle is in the same architectural style David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly probably because of the threat from the French Stone castles were usually time consuming and expensive to build often costing thousands of pounds Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of in France from 1386 to 1387 and as a result was probably absent for the first years of the castle s construction It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge s main residence and the administrative centre of the manor It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392 Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle as he was dead by 1395 Danlyngrigge s estates including the castle were inherited by his son John Dalyngrigge Like his father John enjoyed the favour of the king and was described as the King s Knight in 1400 he was granted an annual allowance of 100 by the king He died on 27 September 1408 leaving a will by which his property passed to his widow Alice during her lifetime Since they had no children at Alice s death which occurred in 1442 it was to pass to John s cousin Richard Dallingrigge son of Edward s brother Walter Upon Richard s death without issue in 1470 his brother William having died before him he left the estates to Sir Roger Lewknor son of Richard s sister Phillippe Dallingridge Phillippe had married Sir Thomas Lewknor of before 1417 and died in 1421 Sir Thomas who made a second marriage died in 1452 By this means Bodiam Castle passed from the Dallingrigge into the Lewknor family Sir Thomas Lewknor son of Sir Roger was a supporter of the during the which began in 1455 When Richard of the ascended to the throne as in 1483 Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising in southeast England In November 1483 Lewknor s uncle and the were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle where Lewknor was based It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance His property was confiscated and Nicholas Rigby was made of the castle On s accession to the English throne the was revoked and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor However not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542 Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries there is little to indicate how it was used in this period or if the family spent much time in it Following the death of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543 his estates were divided among his descendants and the castle and manor were split John Levett of purchased the castle in 1588 In 1623 most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir later His son inherited Nicholas s property on his father s death in 1631 it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639 John Tufton was a supporter of the cause during the and led an attack on and was involved in a Royalist defeat at Parliament confiscated some of his lands in 1643 and more in 1644 as well as fining him 9 000 1 600 000 today To help pay his fine Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for 6 000 1 040 000 today in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell a After the Civil War Powell was made by Although it is unrecorded when Bodiam Castle was dismantled it was probably after it was bought by Powell During and after the Civil War many castles were slighted to prevent them from being reused Not all were destroyed completely and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure At Bodiam it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the the bridges and the buildings inside the castle When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675 Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son also called Nathaniel After the second Nathaniel the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow his daughter in law In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster bought the castle For over a century Bodiam Castle and its associated manor descended through the It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid 18th century when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the and the renovation of old structures The third Sir Godfrey Webster began looking for buyers for the castle in 1815 and in 1829 he finally managed to sell it and 24 acres 10 ha of the surrounding land to for 3 000 270 000 today Fuller repaired one of the towers added new gates to the site and removed a cottage which had been built within the castle in the 18th century he is thought to have bought the castle to prevent the Webster family from dismantling it and reusing its materials later purchased the castle and its 24 acres 9 7 ha from Fuller s grandson in 1849 for over 5 000 520 000 today Cubitt continued the renovations that Fuller started He commissioned the first detailed survey of Bodiam Castle in 1864 and undertook repairs to the tower at the southwest corner of the site which had almost entirely collapsed Because there was then a fashion for ruins covered in ivy the vegetation was not removed despite its detrimental effect on the masonry and the trees which had taken root in the courtyard were left decided that so rare a treasure as Bodiam Castle should neither be lost to our country nor desecrated by irreverent hands Curzon made enquiries about buying the castle but Cubitt did not wish to sell However after Cubitt s death Curzon was able to make a deal with Cubitt s son and he bought Bodiam Castle and its lands in 1916 Curzon began a programme of investigation at Bodiam in 1919 and with architect restored parts of the castle The moat on average about 5 ft 1 5 m deep but 7 ft 2 1 m deep in the southeast corner was drained and 3 ft 0 9 m of mud and silt removed during excavations the original footings of the bridges to the castle were discovered Nearby hedges and fences were removed to provide an unobscured view of the castle There were excavations in the interior and a well was discovered in the basement of the southwest tower Vegetation was cleared stonework repaired and the original floor level re established throughout the castle A cottage was built to provide a museum to display the finds from the excavations and a home for a caretaker Bodiam Castle was given to the National Trust in 1925 The National Trust continued the restoration work and added new roofs to the towers and gatehouse Excavations were resumed in 1970 and the moat was once again drained Bodiam Castle was used in 1975 in an identifying it as Swamp Castle in the Tale of Sir Lancelot sequence It had previously been used for the filming of an episode of broadcast in 1973 It was later the filming location for the serial broadcast in 1983 The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England carried out a survey of the earthworks surrounding Bodiam Castle in 1990 In the 1990s Bodiam Castle was at the centre of a debate in castle studies over the balance between militaristic and social interpretations of such sites The arguments focused on elements such as the apparent strength of the defences such as the imposing moat and elements of display It has been suggested that the moat could have been drained in a day because the embankment surrounding it was not substantial and that as such it did not pose a serious obstacle to an attacker Also the large windows in the castle s exterior were defensive weak points The castle is a which means it is a nationally important historic building and which has been given protection against unauthorised change It is also a Grade I and recognised as an internationally important structure Today the castle is open to the public and according to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions nearly 175 598 people visited in 2017 In the opinion of historian Charles Coulson Bodiam represents the popular ideal of a medieval castle The castle s location was ostensibly chosen to protect England s south coast from raids by the French A landscape survey by the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments concluded that if this were the case then Bodiam Castle was unusually sited as it is far from the medieval coastline The area surrounding Bodiam Castle was landscaped when the castle was built to increase its aesthetic appeal Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam as one of the best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle The water features were originally extensive but only the moat survives along with the earthworks left over from its construction Roughly rectangular the moat is supplied by several springs some of them within it which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle s walls but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable and considers it the equal of the 13th century such as The castle sits roughly in the middle of the moat The gate at the rear would have been connected to the moat s south bank by a drawbridge and a long timber bridge The main entrance on the north side of the castle is today connected to the north bank by a wooden bridge but the original route would have included two bridges one from the main entrance to an island in the moat and another connecting the island to the west bank For the most part the bridge was static apart from the section closest to the west bank which would have been a drawbridge The island in the moat is called the Octagon and excavations on it have uncovered a toilet suggesting that there may have been a guard on the island although it is unclear to what extent it was fortified The Octagon was connected to a barbican by a bridge probably a drawbridge The castle s 28 toilets drained directly into the moat which in the words of archaeologist Matthew Johnson would have been effectively an open sewer A Bodiam is roughly square shaped This type of castle with a central courtyard and buildings against the was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century Bodiam Castle has been described by military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle There are circular towers at each of the four corners with square central towers in the south east and west walls The main entrance is a twin towered in the north face of the castle There is a second entrance from the south the gate is through a square tower in the middle of the south wall The towers are three storeys high taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high Between the Octagon and the main gatehouse in the north wall was a barbican of which little survives just a piece of the west wall although the structure was originally two stories high The surviving fabric includes a slot for a for the barbican s north gate although there are no hinges for gates The base of a garderobe demonstrates that the second story would have provided space for habitation probably a guard room Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as inside the passageway The gatehouse in the castle s north wall is three storeys high now reached by a static bridge it was originally connected to the barbican by a drawbridge The top of the gatehouse is and the approach is overlooked by gun loops in the gatehouse towers The gatehouse is the only part of the castle which has gun loops and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway although it leads nowhere The ceiling of the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with Murder holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers similar to or to pour water to extinguish fires Just above the gate there are three coats of arms carved in into the arch from left to right they are the arms of the Wardeux Dalyngrigge and Radynden families The Wardeux family was that of Edward Dalyngrigge s wife the Radyndens were relations of the Dalyngrigges Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years War but those flanking it are blank Although the exterior of Bodiam Castle has largely survived the interior is ruinous The domestic buildings within the castle lined the curtain walls However remains are substantial enough to recreate a plan of the castle The structure was divided into separate living areas for the lord and his family high status guests the garrisons and servants The south range of the castle consisted of the the kitchens and associated rooms The great hall to the east of the centrally located gate was 24 by 40 feet 7 3 by 12 2 m and would have been as tall as the curtain wall To the west of the great hall was the pantry and buttery linked to the great hall by a The three standing arches gave access to different rooms the pantry buttery and the kitchen which was at the far west of the south range This layout was typical of large medieval houses The great hall was the social centre of the castle and where the lord would have entertained guests The buttery and pantry occupied the bottom floor and above was a room of unknown purpose The buttery had a cellar and was used to store ale and wine while the pantry held the supplies for the kitchen To prevent heat from the cooking fires becoming unbearable the kitchen was as tall as the curtain walls to provide a large space to absorb the heat In the southwest tower was a well from which water would have been drawn for the household Along the east wall is a chapel a hall and an To accommodate the chapel the curtain wall near the northeast corner projects 9 feet 2 7 m further into the moat than the rest of the wall along the east side Immediately south of the chapel was the main accommodation for the lord and his family The buildings were two storeys high and incorporated a basement The exact layout of the rooms is unclear Arranged along the west curtain wall was an extra hall and a kitchen it is not certain what these were used for although it is probable that these were intended to provide for the household s retainers The retainers hall had no windows on its west side and would have been relatively dark compared to the great hall Also whereas the great hall had a large fireplace the retainers hall had none The hall was adjacent to the kitchen to which it was directly connected with no screens passage in between Above the retainers hall which was confined to the ground floor was a room with no fireplace and of unclear purpose East of the main gatehouse was a two storey building with a basement The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation The purpose of the buildings along the west end of the north range is uncertain The sparse arrangement with little provision for lighting has led to suggestions that it was used as stables however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above ground floors and there was a basement underneath 
 the largest city in has an combination of ranging from the to 20th century and beyond During the mid 19th century an architectural style unique to the city was developed and several examples have survived Buildings from most of the of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards Outside the historical city centre there are several large mansions built for wealthy merchants and of the same period survive intermingled with areas of more recent development Several era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class As the city grew it with its surrounding villages each with its own character and centre often clustered around a The construction of the city s taking in the wharves on the and provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure Key elements of which include the designed and the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the but is now closed The 20th century saw further expansion of the city the growth of the and the arrival of the aircraft industry During World War II the was extensively bombed in the The redevelopment of shopping centres office buildings and the harbourside continues to this day The city was defended in medieval times by a fortification built on the site of a wooden predecessor The castle played a key role in the civil wars that followed the death of reconnoitred Bristol in 1138 and claimed that the town was impregnable After Stephen s capture in 1141 he was imprisoned in the castle The castle was later taken into royal hands and spent lavishly on it adding a before the main west gate a gate tower and a magnificent hall By the 16th century the castle had fallen into disuse but the city authorities had no control over royal property and so the castle became a refuge for lawbreakers In 1630 the city purchased the castle ordered its destruction in 1656 An area outside the castle known as was used as a mustering point for troops It later became a market for the country people to set up stalls and sell their wares Old Market was also the site of an autumn fair The market may have existed as early as the 12th century and was the site of the first suburb outside the city walls It had side roads which could accommodate the traffic on market days The city had extensive walls built by These have now largely disappeared although parts remain on properties in A gateway in the old wall can now be seen under the tower of the The earliest surviving church in Bristol is in Horsefair Whitson Street It was founded in 1129 as a priory by The 12th century also saw the founding of and churches now in ruins was built on the site of the oval church of the a Christian military order forcibly disbanded in 1312 Either just before or just after the disappearance of the Templars the church was rebuilt on a rectangular plan and served as a parish church was founded as St Augustine s Abbey in 1140 by along with its associated with the building works continuing in the Gothic style until about 1420 was built around 1220 Soon after the foundations were laid for in The 12th century also saw the foundation of renowned as one of the finest examples of the 15th century and the tallest building in the city on a visit to the city in 1574 described it as the fairest goodliest and most famous parish church in England These 12th century churches were followed in the 14th century by the construction of Church of St John the Baptist and Westbury College was a 13th century College of Priests located in A now a property was added in the 15th century The architectural period which lasted from the late 15th century into the early 17th century saw the development of large estates such as They were built for the local merchants who gained much of their wealth from the trade passing through was constructed in 1580 for John Yonge as the lodge for a great house that once stood on the site of the present In 1615 a number of houses were demolished for the development of the new Fishmarket During the the was considered the strongest part of Bristol s defences and it was to the fort that the retreated when they found themselves under siege from the It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished were built in 1652 to provide care for the poor Several public houses were also built in this period including the on King Street and the More churches were built including It served the St Michaels hill area one of the first areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs such as the villages of and Both had their own churches the and respectively The or period 1666 1713 saw more expansion of the city Large mansions such as and were constructed The needs of the poor and destitute became the responsibility of institutions such as and the The area was developed outside the Back Street Gate of the city home to the The nearby was planned during this era In 1669 a series of four flights of steps now called was constructed to replace a steep muddy and narrow street formerly known as Queene Street Many of the larger houses of this period including Queen Square were built for merchant families who were heavily involved in the importing goods from slave plantations A few African and American Caribbean born slaves came to Bristol as servants In 1732 John Strachan built Redland Court for It now forms one of the buildings making up In 1760 the Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP That led to the demolition of St Nicholas s Gate along with the original St Nicholas church part of the Old Shambles and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure lined with houses on both sides A 17th century illustration shows that these were five stories high including the attic rooms and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street At the time of the the bridge was noted for its community of who may have been attracted by the unusually secure premises The current church was rebuilt in 1762 9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty who rebuilt the spire Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt The 1766 Theatre Royal which claims to be the oldest continually operating theatre in England joined with the Coopers Hall from 1744 and designed by architect to form the During the period of about 1720 1840 the main architects and builders working in Bristol were John Wallis and with his sons John and They put up hundreds of new buildings reflecting the increased prosperity that came with the new and trade based

the Abolition of the African Slave Trade In the collected evidence for on the cruelty of the trade in humans Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the abolition cause including a bust of opposed the trade in humans and in 1774 his sermon at the against slavery was disturbed by explosion Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic including the story of an enslaved African and which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the abolition cause Several residential squares with terraces of three storey houses were laid out around central gardens An example is which was built between 1789 and 1820 and is now largely occupied by offices In the 1830s much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the and to the north of the city Kings Square The most fashionable areas were at the top of the hill as in wet weather the overflowed down the hill Further development though in a less formal manner

including and was the first chapel and a Quaker meeting house known as was built in 1749 The term refers primarily to buildings of the early 19th century when was still and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style It follows closely on from the neo classical Georgian style of architecture adding an elegance and lightness of touch Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door usually coloured black framed by two columns Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents often in a setting of trees and shrubs Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable An instigator of this style was whose most notable work in Bristol is a complex of small cottages surrounding a green It was built around 1811 for the retired employees of banker and who owned Blaise Castle House The cottages are now owned by the National Trust The Clifton and areas provide examples of the developments from the Georgian to the Regency style with many fine terraces and villas facing the road and at right angles to it In the early 19th century the romantic style appeared partially as a backlash to the of and can be seen in buildings such as and church was built between 1839 and 1843 by as a Catholic apostolic chapel for the congregation it is now a Roman Catholic church The saw further expansion of the city both in its industrial heartland around the docks and in the suburbs particularly in Clifton Palatial squares were developed for the prosperous middle classes and villas made with and sitting in their own gardens were built in areas such as At the same time hundreds of acres of working class and artisan homes were built especially in the south and east of the city To support the growing population public service buildings such as the Beaufort Hospital now schools such as and public houses such as the were constructed Between 1849 and 1870 five large stone buildings were erected by to care for 2 050 orphans in his is situated in a public park on Brandon Hill It was built in 1897 by in memory of 400 years after he set sail from Bristol and landed on what is now A notable feature of Bristol s architecture is the style Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches this style was used in the construction of factories warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era Surviving examples include the Colston Hall the and the along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived including the which now houses an art gallery the in Silverthorne Lane and the in St Thomas Street are other survivors from the 19th century The local is frequently used as walling material often with limestone dressings as found on the old and Pennant sandstone is also used as large rock faced squared blocks described as which are used alone eked out with plain brickwork or incorporated into the more rugged examples of Bristol Byzantine Much of the local transport infrastructure including the and the original Temple Meads railway station now used as the were designed or built by In 1864 after over 100 years of planning the Clifton Suspension Bridge over the linked the city to the Ashton Court estate However development to the west of the remained limited with its detailed ceramic frontage was constructed in 1900 In the early part of the 20th century further expansion took place in residential districts increasingly distant from the city centre was designed by and opened on 16 December 1912 The was commissioned in 1912 by and the magnates of the Bristol tobacco company in honour of their father benefactor and first Chancellor of the was chosen as architect and told to build to last He produced a design in the style to evoke the famous university buildings of and The university also took over several existing houses such as Royal Fort Goldney Hall and buildings on and the surrounding areas Oatley was also involved in the design or restoration of other buildings in Bristol in the early part of the 20th century including the restoration of John Wesley s original Methodist chapel the New Room The 1930s saw the construction of the and the planning of the new although this was not completed until 1956 As a centre of aircraft manufacturing Bristol was a target for bombing during the of World War II Bristol s city centre was severely damaged especially in November and December 1940 when the area was flattened and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city The original central area near the bridge and castle is now a featuring two bombed out churches and fragments of the castle A third bombed church has been given a new lease of life as the St Nicholas Church Museum Slightly to the north the shopping centre was built over bomb damaged areas to the north of the city centre was built during the early 1970s Like much of British post war development the regeneration of was characterised by Modernist architecture including Brutalist towers such as one of several notable examples of brutalist architecture in the city and improvement and expansion to road infrastructure The world s oldest in Redcliffe was lost to road development in 1968 being replaced the following year by the on a different site Since the 1990s this trend has been reversing limiting access with the closure of a number of main roads whilst the Broadmead shopping centre has been further developed In 2006 one of the city centre s tallest Mid Century Modern towers was lost with further historic 20th century structures being destroyed more recently The transfer of the docks to downstream from the city centre relieved congestion in the centre of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area the Floating Harbour The continued existence of the central docks was for some time in jeopardy as they were seen to be remnants of a derelict industry instead of an asset to be developed for public use In the 1990s a harbourside concert hall designed by architects was planned but an decision cut the funding and the project has not been revived This has left formerly At Bristol which mixes art science and nature with its all reflective planetarium as the centrepiece of the Harbourside development The shopping centre was redeveloped in the early years of the century involving the demolition of one the city s tallest mid century towers in the construction of The was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding In 2005 the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of tall buildings in Bristol and identified support for new tall buildings so long as they are well designed sustainable distinctive and fit into the existing urban landscape In May 2007 proposals were announced to build approximately net of homes offices and business premises in the The development if it had been approved would have included a 40 storey tower next to the acting as a new entrance to the city The tower would have been a similar shape to the in London Planning for the large development across the from Castle Park including the old Georges Brewery buildings was first granted in 2006 but progress was hampered by the recession and the developers went into receivership By 2015 the development is part complete with the historic waterfront facade still awaiting regeneration Since 2013 Bristol has seen an increase in buildings being built or office blocks being converted for student accommodation These include St Lawrence House a former office block in Broad Street the former Magistrates Court site and A roster of the tallest

 for Red Castle is a 19th century castle built above the village of in The first castle on the site was built by the Normans after 1081 to protect the newly conquered town of and control the route along the Abandoned shortly afterwards the castle s earth was reused by as the basis for a new stone fortification which he built between 1267 and 1277 to control his freshly annexed Welsh lands This castle was likely destroyed in the rebellion of 1314 In 1760 the castle ruins were acquired by as part of a marriage settlement that brought the family vast estates in South Wales the 3rd Marquess of Bute inherited the castle in 1848 One of Britain s wealthiest men with interests in and studies he employed the architect to reconstruct the castle as a country residence for occasional occupation in the summer using the medieval remains as a basis for the design Burges rebuilt the outside of the castle between 1875 and 1879 before turning to the interior he died in 1881 and the work was finished by Burges s remaining team in 1891 Bute reintroduced commercial into Britain planting a vineyard just below the castle and wine production continued until the The Marquess made little use of his new retreat and in 1950 his grandson the placed it into the care of the state It is now controlled by the Welsh heritage agency Castell Coch s external features and the interiors led the historian David McLees to describe it as one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition The exterior based on 19th century studies by the antiquarian is relatively authentic in style although its three stone towers were adapted by Burges to present a dramatic silhouette closer in design to mainland European castles such as than native British fortifications The interiors were elaborately decorated with specially designed furniture and fittings the designs include extensive use of symbolism drawing on and themes wrote that the castle represented the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript The surrounding contain rare plant species and unusual geological features and are protected as a The first castle on the Castell Coch site was probably built after 1081 during the It formed one of a string of eight fortifications intended to defend the newly conquered town of and control the route along the It took the form of a raised earth work about 35 metres 115 ft across at the base and 25 metres 82 ft on the top protected by the surrounding steep slopes The 16th century historian Rice Merrick claimed that the castle was built by the Welsh lord but there are no records of this phase of the castle s history and modern historians doubt this account The first castle was probably abandoned after 1093 when the Norman lordship of Glamorgan was created changing the line of the frontier In 1267 who held the seized the lands around the town of in the north of Glamorgan from their native Welsh ruler was built to control the new territory and Castell Coch strategically located between Cardiff and Caerphilly was reoccupied A new castle was built in stone around the motte comprising a shell wall a projecting circular tower a and a square hall above an The north west section of the walls was protected by a and the sides of the motte were to increase their angle all producing a small but powerful fortification Further work followed between 1268 and 1277 which added two large towers a turning bridge for the gatehouse and further protection to the north west walls On Gilbert s death the castle passed to his widow and around this time it was referred to as Latin for the Red Castle probably after the colour of the Red defences Gilbert s son also named inherited the property in 1307 He died at the in 1314 triggering an uprising of the in the region Castell Coch was probably destroyed by the rebels in July 1314 and possibly to put it beyond any further use it was not rebuilt and the site was abandoned Castell Coch remained derelict the visiting around 1536 described it as all in ruin no big thing but high The artist and illustrator painted the castle in 1792 depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower with a in operation alongside the fortification Stone from the castle may have been robbed and used to feed the kilns during this period A similar view was sketched by an unknown artist in the early 19th century showing more trees around the ruins a few years later Robert Drane recommended the site as a place for picnics and noted its abundance in wild The ruins were acquired by the in 1760 when the 3rd Earl and from 1794 the 1st Marquess married adding her estates in South Wales to his inheritance John s grandson developed the in the first half of the 19th century although the docks were not especially profitable they opened opportunities for the expansion of the coal industry in the South Wales valleys making the Bute family extremely wealthy The 2nd Marquess carried out exploration for at Castell Coch in 1827 and considered establishing an ironworks there The 3rd Marquess of Bute another inherited the castle and the family estates as a child in 1848 On his coming of age Bute s landed estates and industrial inheritance made him one of the wealthiest men in the world He had a wide range of interests including archaeology theology linguistics and history Interest in medieval architecture increased in Britain during the 19th century and in 1850 the antiquarian surveyed Castell Coch and published his findings the first major scholarly work about the castle The ruins were covered in rubble ivy brushwood and weeds the keep had been largely destroyed and the gatehouse was so covered with debris that Clark failed to discover it Nonetheless Clark considered the external walls tolerably perfect and advised that the castle be conserved complete with the ivy covered stonework In 1871 Bute asked his chief Cardiff engineer John McConnochie to excavate and clear the castle ruins The report on the investigations was produced by an architect with an interest in medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865 The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop in the late 1860s and the two men became close collaborators Burges s lavishly illustrated report which drew extensively on Clark s earlier work laid out two options either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer On receipt of the report Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style The reconstruction of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875 because of the demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess s trustees that he was facing bankruptcy On commencement the Kitchen Tower Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse and the Keep Tower last Burges s drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of The drawings were supplemented by a large number of wooden and plaster models from smaller pieces to full size models of furniture The bulk of the external work was complete by the end of 1879 The result closely followed Burges s original plans with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a and some defensive timber both of which were not undertaken Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features such as the drawbridge and against surviving designs at other British castles Burges s team of craftsmen at Castell Coch included many who had worked with him at Cardiff Castle and elsewhere his office manager designed most of the furnishings and furniture and acted as was Burges s chief artist painting extensive murals at the castle His main sculptor was together with another long time collaborator the Italian sculptor Stimulated by antiquarian writings about British viticulture Bute decided to reintroduce commercial into Britain in 1873 He sent his gardener Andrew Pettigrew to France for training and planted a 1 2 hectare 3 acre vineyard just beneath the castle in 1875 The first harvests were poor and the initial harvest in 1877 produced only 240 bottles magazine claimed that any wine produced would be so unpleasant that it would take four men to drink it two to hold the victim and one to pour the wine down his throat By 1887 the output was 3 000 bottles of of reasonable quality Bute persevered commercial success followed and 40 of wine including a using grapes were produced annually by 1894 to positive reviews Burges died in 1881 after catching a severe during a site visit to the castle His brother in law the architect took over the commission and delegated most of the work to Frame who directed the work on the interior until its completion in 1891 Bute and his wife Gwendolen were consulted over the details of the interior decoration replica family portraits based on those at Cardiff were commissioned to hang on the walls Clark approved of the result commenting in 1884 that the restoration was in excellent taste An originally built on the roof of the Well Tower was removed before 1891 but in other respects the completed castle was left unaltered The castle was not greatly used the Marquess rarely visited after its completion The property had probably only been intended for limited informal use for example as a retreat following picnics Although it had reception rooms suitable for large gatherings it had only three bedrooms and was too far from Cardiff for casual visits The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments Bute died in 1900 and his widow the Marchioness was given a in Castell Coch during her mourning she and her daughter Lady Margaret Crichton Stuart occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted the 4th Marquess acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it He also began to reduce the family s investments in South Wales The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the by 1938 the great majority of the family interests including the coal mines and docks had been sold off or nationalised The another John succeeded in 1947 and in 1950 he placed the castle in the care of the The Marquess also disposed of Cardiff Castle which he gave to the city removing the family portraits from the castle before doing so In turn the paintings in Castell Coch were removed by the ministry and sent to Cardiff the providing alternatives from their collection for Castell Coch Academic interest in the property grew with publications in the 1950s and 1960s exploring its artistic and architectural value Since 1984 the property has been administered by an agency of the and is open to the public it received 69 466 visitors in 2011 The Drawing Room is available for wedding ceremonies The castle has also been used as a location for filming The castle s exposed position causes it to suffer from and periodic restoration work has been necessary The stone tiles on the roof were replaced by slate in 1972 a major programme was carried out on the Keep in 2007 and interior conservation work was undertaken in 2011 to address problems in Lady Bute s Bedroom where damp had begun to damage the finishings The original furnishings many of which the Marquess removed in 1950 have mostly been recovered and returned to their original locations in the castle Two stained glass panels from the demolished chapel lost since 1901 were rediscovered at an auction in 2010 and were bought by Cadw for 125 000 in 2011 Castell Coch occupies a stretch of woodland on the slopes above the village of and the River Taff about 10 6 kilometres 6 6 mi north west of the centre of Cardiff The architecture is High Victorian Gothic Revival in style influenced by contemporary 19th century French restorations Its design combines the surviving elements of the medieval castle with 19th century additions to produce a building which the historian Charles Kightly considered the crowning glory of the Gothic Revival in Britain It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building due to its exceptional architectural and historical interest The castle comprises three circular towers the Keep the Kitchen Tower and the Well Tower along with the Hall Block the Gatehouse and a shell wall the buildings almost entirely encase the original motte in stone The older parts of the castle are constructed from crudely laid red rubble and grey the 19th century additions in more precisely cut red A ditch is cut out of the rock in front of the Gatehouse and leads to an eastern approach road The castle is surrounded by woodland and the 19th century vineyards below it have been converted into a golf course In 1850 George Clark recorded an outer court of which nothing remains this may in fact have been the traces of the earlier lime kiln operations around the site The Gatehouse is reached across a wooden bridge incorporating a drawbridge Burges intended the bridge to copy those of medieval castles which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire in the event of attack The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive and above the entrance Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna The Keep is 12 metres 39 ft in diameter with a square spurred base in the 13th century there would have been an adjacent turret on the south west side containing latrines but few traces remain There is no evidence that the tower that Burges termed a would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower The Kitchen Tower is also 12 metres 39 ft across and rests on a square spurred base It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen Burgess raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys The walls of these two towers are around 3 0 metres 10 ft thick at the base thinning to 0 61 metres 2 ft at the top The Well Tower at 11 5 metres 38 ft in diameter is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground The Well Tower lacks the spurs of the other two towers and has a flat rather than curved back facing onto the courtyard similar to some of the towers built at Caerphilly by the de Clares The towers contribute to what the architectural writer considered the castle s sculptural and dramatic exterior Almost equal in diameter but of differing conical roof designs and heights and topped with copper gilt weather vanes they combine to produce a romantic appearance which Matthew Williams described as bringing a Wagnerian flavor to the Taff Valley The design of the towers was influenced by the work of the contemporary French architect including his restorations of and the châteaus of and While the exterior of Castell Coch is relatively true to English 13th century medieval design albeit heavily influenced by the Gothic Revival movement the inclusion of the conical roofs which more closely resemble those of fortifications in France or Switzerland than Britain is historically inaccurate Although he mounted a historical defence see box Burges chose the roofs mainly for architectural effect arguing that they appeared more picturesque and to provide additional room for accommodation in the castle The three towers lead into a small oval courtyard that sits on the top of the motte about 19 5 metres 64 ft across lengthways Cantilevered galleries and wall walks run around the inside of the courtyard with neat and orderly woodwork the historian critiqued it as perhaps too much like the backcloth for an historical pageant Burges reconstructed the shell wall that runs along the north west side of the courtyard 0 99 metres 3 ft 3 in thick complete with arrow holes and a battlement The Keep the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower incorporate a series of apartments of which the main sequence the Castellan s Rooms lies within the Keep The Hall the Drawing Room Lord Bute s Bedroom and Lady Bute s Bedroom form a suite of rooms that exemplify the High Victorian Gothic style of 19th century Britain Unlike the exterior of the castle which deliberately imitated the architecture of the 13th century the interior was purely High Victorian in style On Burges s decoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch Handley Read wrote I have yet to see any High Victorian interiors from the hand very largely of one designer to equal either in homogeneity or completeness in quality of execution or originality of conception the best of the interiors of the Welsh castles For sheer power of intoxication Burges stand s unrivalled The Banqueting Hall is 6 1 by 9 1 metres 20 by 30 ft across with an 11 metre 35 ft ceiling and occupies the whole of the first floor of the Hall Block Burges persuaded Bute and the antiquarian George Clark that the medieval hall would have stood on the first floor His original plan saw access via one of two equally circuitous routes through the Well Tower or around the entire internal gallery to enter the hall through a passage next to the Drawing Room Neither approach was acceptable to Bute and at a late stage around 1878 9 the present entrance was created by expanding a window at the head of the internal gallery The hall is austere the architectural historian critiqued its decoration as dilute and unfocused Crook as anaemic It features ceilings and murals which resemble medieval manuscripts The murals were designed by Horatio Lonsdale and executed by Campbell Smith Company The furniture is by John Chapple made in Lord Bute s workshops at Cardiff The tapered chimney of the room modelled on 15th century French equivalents contains a statue carved by Thomas Nicholls Although the architectural historian suggested that the statue depicts the Hebrew most historians believe that it shows according to legend the founder of the in nearby Cardiff The octagonal Drawing Room occupies the first and second floors of the Keep The ceiling is supported by vaulted stone ribs modelled on Viollet Le Duc s work at and the lower and upper halves of the room are divided by a The original plans for the space involved two chambers one on each floor and the new design was adopted only in 1879 Burges noting at the time that he intended to indulge in a little more ornament than elsewhere in the castle The decoration of the room focuses on what Newman described as the intertwined themes of the fecundity of nature and the fragility of life A fireplace by Thomas Nicholls features the the trio of Greek goddesses who are depicted spinning measuring and cutting the thread of life The ceiling s vaulting is carved with butterflies reaching up to a golden sunburst at the apex of the room while plumed birds fly up into a starry sky in the intervening sections Around the room 58 panels each depicting one or more unique plants are surmounted by a mural showing animals from twenty four of The plants are wild flowers from the Mediterranean where Lord Bute spent his winter months each year Carved birds lizards and other wildlife decorate the doorways The historian Terry Measham wrote that the Drawing Room and Lady Bute s Bedroom so powerful in their effect are the two most important interiors in the castle The architectural writer Andrew Lilwall Smith considered the Drawing Room to be Burges s pièce de résistance encapsulating his romantic vision of the Middle Ages The decoration of the ceiling which was carried out while Burges was alive differs in tone from the treatment of the murals and the decoration of Lady Bute s Bedroom which were both completed under the direction of William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale respectively after Burges s death Burges s work is distinctively High Gothic in style while the later efforts are more influenced by the softer colours and character of the which had grown in popularity by the 1880s In comparison to other rooms within the castle Lord Bute s Bedroom sited above the Winch Room is relatively small and simple The original plan had Bute s personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double height room in 1879 required a late change of plan The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post dates Burges although the washstand and dressing table are pared down versions of two pieces the and the Crocker Dressing Table that Burges made for his own home in London This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle making extensive use of plain stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls Crook suggested this provided some spartan relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute s Bedroom but Floud considered the result thin and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use lacking wardrobes and other storage Lady Bute s Bedroom comprises the upper two floors of the Keep with a double dome ceiling that rises up into the tower s conical roof The room was completed after Burges s death and although he had created an outline model for the room s structure which survives he did not undertake detailed plans for its decoration His team attempted to fulfil his vision for the room would Mr Burges have done it William Frame asked Nicholls in a letter of 1887 but the interior decoration was the work of Lonsdale between 1887 and 1888 with considerable involvement from Bute and his wife The room is circular with the window embrasures forming a sequence of around the outside It is richly decorated with as the theme displaying carved monkeys pomegranates and grapevines on the ceiling and nesting birds topping the pillars Lord Bute thought the monkeys inappropriately lascivious Above the fireplace is a winged statue of the Greek goddess of the soul carrying a heart shaped shield which displays the arms of the Bute family The washbasin designed by John Chapple has a dragon tap and for hot and cold water covered with towers The Marchioness s scarlet and gold bed is the most notable piece of furniture in the room modelled on a medieval original drawn by Viollet le Duc Crook described the bed as being medieval to the point of acute discomfort The bedroom is Moorish in style a popular inspiration in mid Victorian interior design and echoes earlier work by Burges in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle and in the chancel at at Studley Royal in Yorkshire Lilwall Smith likened the chamber with its Moorish looking dome maroon and gold painted furniture and large low bed decorated with glass crystal orbs to a scene from the Peter Floud criticised the eclectic nature of this Moorish theme and contrasted it unfavourably with the more consistent style Burges applied to the Arab Room suggesting that it gave the bedroom an overly theatrical even pantomime like character The historian Matthew Williams considered that Lonsdale s efforts lack the imagination and flair that Burges himself might have brought to the room The Windlass Room or Winch Room is in the Gatehouse entered from the Drawing Room It contains a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis The equipment was originally intended for the second floor which Burges considered the most historically authentic location When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute s Bedroom into that space the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor The Windlass Room includes which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour on attackers An oratory originally fitted to the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891 was decorated with twenty stained glass windows Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle while the other ten are displayed on site two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011 Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute s Bedroom

The also spelled from was a fortified in built by ruler of the following his sack of the city in 168 The fortress played a significant role in the formation of the and in the where it was destroyed by The exact location of the Acra critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem had been a matter of lengthy discussions Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources Jerusalem s geography and previously discovered artifacts had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the platform as a clue to the Acra s possible position During s 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the Mount features were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra including barrack like rooms and a huge In 2015 the announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location south west of the Temple Mount and north west of the The Ancient Greek term was used to describe other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period The Acra is often called the to distinguish it from references to the as an and from the later quarter in Jerusalem which inherited the name Acra Following s death in 323 BCE was contested between the in Egypt and the Seleucid Empire based in Syria and Mesopotamia Seleucid emperor s victory over Egypt in the brought Judea under Seleucid control The population of Jerusalem had aided Antiochus during his siege of the Baris the fortified base of Jerusalem s Egyptian garrison Their support was rewarded with a charter affirming Jewish religious autonomy including barring foreigners and impure animals from the and an allocation of official funds for the maintenance of certain religious rituals in the Temple Despite being allowed religious freedom many Jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential Greek lifestyle The imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement and this led to the formation of Hellenistic elites among the Jewish population produced tensions between observant Jews and their brethren who had assimilated Greek culture ascended the Seleucid throne in 175 BCE Shortly afterward Epiphanes was petitioned by for appointment to the position of of an office occupied by his brother Jason himself thoroughly Hellenized furthermore promised to increase the tribute paid by the city and to establish within it the infrastructure of a Greek including a and an Jason s petition was granted yet after a 42 month rule he was ousted by Antiochus and forced to flee to In the meantime Antiochus IV had launched two invasions of Egypt in 170 BCE and again in 169 BCE and routed the Ptolemaic armies Antiochus victories were short lived His intent to unify the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms alarmed the rapidly expanding which demanded that he withdraw his forces from Egypt With Antiochus engaged in Egypt a false rumor spread in Jerusalem that he had been killed In the ensuing uncertainty Jason gathered a force of 1 000 followers and attempted to take Jerusalem by storm Although the attack was repulsed when word of the fighting reached Antiochus in Egypt he suspected his Judean subjects of exploiting his setback as an opportunity to revolt In 168 BCE Antiochus IV Epiphanes marched on and sacked Jerusalem looting the temple treasury and killing thousands of its residents Reversing his father s policy Antiochus IV issued decrees outlawing traditional Jewish rites and persecuting observant Jews Temple rituals were discontinued Jewish observance of prohibited and outlawed To consolidate his hold on the city monitor events on the Temple Mount and safeguard the Hellenized faction in Jerusalem Antiochus stationed a Seleucid garrison in the city The name Acra derived from the Greek and signified a lofty fortified place overlooking a town In Jerusalem the word came to symbolize anti Jewish paganism a fortress of the impious and wicked Dominating both the city and the surrounding countryside it was occupied not only by a Greek garrison but by their Jewish confederates as well The Seleucid suppression of Jewish religious life met with considerable resistance among the native population While Antiochus was occupied in the east during 167 BCE a rural priest of raised a rebellion against the empire Both the Seleucid administration and the local Hellenized faction failed to grasp the magnitude of the revolt In 164 BCE liberated Jerusalem and reconsecrated the Temple Although the surrounding city had fallen the Acra and its inhabitants held out Maccabaeus besieged the fortress whose inhabitants sent an appeal to the Seleucid king now for assistance A Seleucid army was dispatched to put down the revolt When it laid siege to Maccabaeus was forced to abandon his siege of the Acra and face Antiochus in battle In the subsequent the Seleucids won their first victory over the and Maccabaeus was forced to withdraw Spared from capitulation the Acra persisted as a Seleucid stronghold for 20 more years during which it weathered several attempts to oust the Greek garrison Judas was killed in 160 BCE and succeeded by his brother who attempted to build a barrier to cut off the Acra s supply line Jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of Seleucid general at Having invited Jonathan to a friendly conference Tryphon had him seized and murdered Jonathan was succeeded by another brother Simon who besieged and finally captured the Acra in 141 BCE Two sources provide information about the ultimate fate of the Acra although their accounts are contradictory in places According to Josephus Simon razed the Acra after ousting its inhabitants and then quarried the hill on which it had stood to render it lower than the temple purge the city of its evil memory and deny it to any future occupier of Jerusalem The account appearing in paints a different picture Thus in this version Simon did not immediately demolish the Acra but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself 1 Maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate The fortress had been built as an internal checkpoint to monitor and control Jerusalem and its population If situated in the as most scholars agree its location would have added very little to Jerusalem s defenses against external threats It may have fallen out of use and been dismantled around the end of the 2nd century BCE following the construction of the and Hasmonean Palace in Jerusalem s upper city offers a different theory The Acra was still standing in 139 BCE when demanded it back from Simon along with and two Hellenized cities Simon had captured Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but made no mention of the Acra It was at this point that he must have sealed its fate as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem Thus when Antiochus VII subdued the city during s reign each and every one of his demands were met except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city Hyrcanus may have been able to reject and Antiochus to drop this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison as the Acra would no longer have been standing This explanation places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130s BCE The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in where it is described as residing in the Lower City upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure The location of the lower part of the city elsewhere referred to as the Lower City at the time of Josephus 1st century CE is accepted to be Jerusalem s south eastern hill the original urban center traditionally known as the Lying to the south of the Temple Mount however the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres 98 ft above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later expansion of the Temple enclosure The elevation decreases to the south of this point Josephus a native of Jerusalem would have been well aware of this discrepancy yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount however has failed to locate any evidence for such large scale quarrying On the contrary excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the time of Josephus or that a large hill had been cleared away This had led many researchers to disregard Josephus account and his placing of the Acra and suggest several alternate locations Since 1841 when proposed the area near the as the site of the Acra at least nine different locations in and around the have been put forward Several researchers have attempted to place the Acra in the Upper City on Jerusalem s western hill within the area currently occupied by the Old City s These propositions seek to locate the Acra within the Hellenistic polis established in Jerusalem according to This conjectural new city would have been in plan and therefore would have required a flat expanse of land which only the western hill could have provided Furthermore the eastern edge of the hill is adjacent to the Temple Mount and higher in altitude two characteristics attributed to the Seleucid citadel Opponents of this proposed location point out that there is very little archaeological or historical evidence supporting the establishment of a Hellenistic polis within Jerusalem let alone sited on the western hill which appears to have been only sparsely populated during the Hellenistic period Excavations in today s Jewish Quarter display evidence of habitation from the as well as renewed Hasmonean and settlement but scant evidence of Hellenistic occupation Research into the dispersal of stamped handles has revealed that over 95 of these handles found in Jerusalem were excavated from the City of David indicating the city had not yet expanded to the western hill during Seleucid rule Furthermore the western hill is separated from the Temple Mount and the City of David by the steep a distinct tactical disadvantage for any force that may have been required to intervene in events within the temple precincts or heavily populated eastern sectors of Jerusalem The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem Sources indicate that an earlier citadel the Ptolemaic Baris had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple s precincts Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time span it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege These factors coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction this may not have been the case 12 253 may be translated to give the sense that the impious or wicked had remained rather than dwelt in the citadel which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new proposes that Josephus wrote of a citadel in the lower part of the city to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE a city that did feature two citadels the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace As Josephus Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill a citadel in the lower city could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it In his view this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem s population center Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels it was not meant as a defence against external threat but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city a role incompatible with a proposed northern location The available sources do indicate the Acra stood south of the temple and because 1 Maccabees is a contemporaneous account of the Maccabean revolt its account of the Acra 1 35 38 is considered the most reliable Josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which the Acra had stood yet his description of the end of the 70 CE provides additional evidence for it being located south of the Temple Mount As the other buildings mentioned in the account all stood to the south in the Lower City this also places the Acra there This account attests to the persistence of the name Acra in this part of Jerusalem many years after Hellenistic rule ended and its citadels had been overthrown and it can also be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city Indeed several clauses in 1 Maccabees may be read as making a similar point These suggest that after the sacking of Jerusalem by Antiochus IV in 168 BCE at least part of the City of David to the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a fortified Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem More than a citadel it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived This is also supported by archaeological evidence including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE and are uncharacteristic of era Jewish burial practices yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in Even if the name Acra were applied to an entire Hellenistic quarter rather than to just a fortress it is likely that a citadel would have stood within that compound to billet the Macedonian garrison which occupied it It was normal for a Hellenistic city to have a fortified stronghold at or near the highest point of its walled area Thus whether a part of a larger enclave or independent of its surroundings a citadel probably did stand at the northern tip of the City of David just south of the Temple Mount Archaeologists have tried to use finds from excavations conducted in the area to pinpoint this citadel s precise location has attempted to place the Acra underneath the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount enclosure Tsafrir points to a straight vertical seam in the enclosure s eastern masonry wall as evidence of different periods of construction North of the seam is an early section of the wall built of large blocks These blocks have faces with drafted margins around a prominent and are laid in homogeneous header and courses one above the other This style of construction is Hellenistic and distinct from the Herodian construction apparent south of the seam Although the exact dating of this construction in uncertain Tsafrir believes it is a remnant of the Acra s foundations which were later incorporated into s extension of the Temple platform As further proof Tzafrir also points to significant similarity between construction methods evident north of the seam including the use of trapezoid shaped stones with the methods employed in the Seleucid city of in 1 Macabees 1 30 attributes construction of the Acra to Apollonius Antiochus III s chief collector which appears to be an ancient mistranslation or his original title as chief of the a people of Asia Minor believed that the Acra stood just south of the of the southern wall of the Herodian Temple Mount platform Benjamin Mazar s excavations of the the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large cistern both possibly dating to the Hellenistic period These have been tentatively identified as remnants of the Acra with the structure featuring rows of small interconnected rooms believed to be the remains of a barracks These had been demolished and built over during the Hasmonean period matching the descriptions in Josephus The Hasmonean constructions were in turn flattened to create a public square fronting the main gates to the Temple platform during the Herodian renovations Several cisterns under the Temple Mount itself have also been proposed as possible remnants of the Seleucid citadel These include a 700 000 3 200 000 l 840 000 US gal cistern shaped like an E the northern edge of which is adjacent to the proposed southern line of the Temple Mount precinct before its Herodian expansion This has been identified as the be er haqar or bor heqer mentioned in the Erubin Tract 10 14 and commonly translated perhaps incorrectly as the cold well Additional evidence for the existence of the Acra may come from the chance discovery published by of a fragmentary Greek inscription in the Old City of Jerusalem The inscription is a fragment from the top of a sandstone stele and contains what may be an oath taken by soldiers stationed in the Acra although the reading of the name Acra in the text has been contested In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the probable discovery of the Acra According to archaeologists Yana Tchekhanovets and Salome Cohen excavating the adjacent to the City of David they had unearthed a complex of rooms and fortified walls they identified as the Acra This places it slightly south of previous suggested locations on the Ophel Finds include fortification walls a watchtower measuring 4 by 20 meters and a Bronze arrowheads lead sling stones and stones were unearthed at the site stamped with a trident the emblem of Antiochus IV Epiphanes These are indicative of the military nature of the site and the efforts to take it The excavation also yielded coins from the reigns of Antiochus IV through Antiochus VII as well as a multitude of stamped Rhodian handles The Givati location has been questioned due to its being too low on the hill to overlook the Temple Mount as described in literary sources 
 The one of the of the are to the west of the city centre of England and stand on the site of the basin of the was founded in 1937 after a donation to the University by the car manufacturer he gave land for the college as well as 900 000 approximately 246 million in present day terms to build and endow it The architect who had worked in Greece and Palestine was appointed by the University to design the buildings His initial design heavily influenced by Mediterranean architecture was rejected by Nuffield who called it un English and refused to allow his name to be associated with it Harrison reworked the plans aiming for something on the lines of as Nuffield wanted Construction of the second design began in 1949 and was finished in 1960 Progress was hampered by post war building restrictions and the effects of inflation on Nuffield s donation led to various cost saving changes to the plans In one change the tower which had been planned to be ornamental was redesigned to hold the college s library It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years and is about 150 feet 46 m tall including the on top The buildings are arranged around two with residential accommodation for students and in one and the hall library and administrative offices in the other The chapel has windows designed by The architectural historian said that Harrison s first design was Oxford s most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s it has also been described as a missed opportunity to show that Oxford did not live only in the past Reaction to the architecture of the college has been largely unfavourable In the 1960s it was described as Oxford s biggest monument to barren reaction The tower has been described as ungainly and marred by repetitive windows The travel writer wrote that the college was a hodge podge from the start However the architectural historian although unimpressed with most of the college thought that the tower helped the Oxford skyline and predicted it would one day be loved The writer doubted Pevsner s prediction and claimed that vegetation was the best hope for the tower as well as the rest of the college The history of dates from 16 November 1937 when the entered a Deed of Covenant and Trust with Nuffield known as William Morris before he was raised to the peerage was an industrialist and the founder of which was based in east Oxford For the creation of Nuffield College and for his other donations which included funding a chair of Spanish studies and donating 2 million in 1936 for a school of medical research he was described in 1949 by an editorial in as the greatest benefactor of the University since the Middle Ages He donated land on New Road to the west of the city centre near the mound of on the site of the largely disused basin of the In 1937 described the half mile between the and the city an area including the site of the proposed college as something between a refuse heap and a slum Nuffield had originally bought the canal basin to beautify that part of the city before he had the idea of building a college to accomplish this As well as the land Nuffield gave 900 000 to build the college and to provide it with an endowment fund His plan was to create a college that specialised in engineering and business methods to provide a link between academia and industry for which he initially offered the University 1 million 100 000 was used for a physical chemistry laboratory completed in 1941 of which he approved However although he was persuaded to put the remainder towards a college for social science studies instead he still felt cheated He later described the college as that bloody Kremlin where left wingers study at my expense He was sufficiently pleased with the work of the college to leave it most of his remaining fortune which was more than 3 million when he died in 1963 although most of the bequest did not reach the college as it was needed to pay on Nuffield s estate Administration of Nuffield s donation was the responsibility of the University as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War A sub committee consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges from from and from was appointed to choose the architect Emden appears to have played the major part in the group s work Eight architects were initially asked to compete including and All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work and the sub committee then recommended Harrison a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938 At that time Harrison had never worked in Britain although he had qualified there he had practised in Greece and Palestine Indeed the college seems to have been his only project in the country and remains his best known work along with his later Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style Nuffield agreed to Harrison s appointment but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work When Nuffield s donation was announced it was reported that the general idea was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens similar to the memorial gardens at so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a beautiful vista of well planned gardens seen through railings this idea did not form part of Harrison s designs After Harrison s preliminary studies it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site with the institute on the second site The hall was to be at the east end of the main site aligned east to west with a tower at the west end the upper to the immediate west of the hall and aligned north to south would have the Warden s Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end steps would lead down from the upper quadrangle into the lower quadrangle again aligned east to west with the main entrance at the far east end of the lower quadrangle The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street The sub committee recommended that Harrison s plans be adopted in January 1939 and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 he had been abroad for much of the intervening period Harrison s design had little that was English still less that was recognisably Oxonian said the architectural historian There were no pitched roofs battlements or pinnacles Instead the proposed building had a strongly Mediterranean character inspired by medieval buildings in that region White was the chosen building material there were to be stark external walls and flat roofs and a large semi circular doorway at the main entrance with facetted demonstrating the influence of the of The tower which was to have an internal dome and an external design showed in Colvin s view influences of and parts of southern France In the hall there were to be on the north and south sides of the main body of the hall as in a with the arches and columns of the aisles designed in a Greek The hall and its grand staircase said Colvin would have rivalled those of Christ Church Although Harrison had not finished plans for the the initial sketches had oriental touches including fireplaces reminiscent of the in Istanbul The Warden s Lodging would have been one of the most handsome and commodious of its kind However Colvin thought that the chapel design was better suited to Mediterranean sunlight than Oxford gloom Colvin said that the relationship between the principal buildings was elegantly worked out and in a university of self contained spaces a design using two intersecting axes one from the entrance to the hall and tower the other from the chapel to the lodging represented an innovation in planning that was highly effective Colvin s view was that the failure to construct the college according to this impressive design led to it being Oxford s most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s Had it been built he said it would have taken its place among the major architectural monuments of Oxford Nuffield was dismayed by the model of Harrison s plans as the buildings were not in the general Oxford collegiate style that he was known to favour After a meeting with the University s Vice Chancellor Nuffield wrote to him on 15 August 1939 to say that he felt obliged to adhere to my adverse judgement of the plans The design was un English and out of keeping with the best tradition of Oxford architecture said Nuffield adding that if a building of this type were to be erected I would not allow my name to be associated therewith Harrison protested that the so called Oxford architectural tradition was a vague concept and also an accident of history there was no uniform style uniting the buildings of the university and colleges but instead different designs had been used with varying modifications over many centuries Only a compromise would suit a 20th century donor with an industrial background who sighs for romance a committee of economists who are after results and the governing committee of a University steeped in its tradition Nevertheless Harrison agreed to attempt to satisfy Nuffield s desire for something on the lines of domestic architecture and produced a second design The amount of accommodation provided was reduced The main entrance was moved from the west to the south of the college under the chapel it was to have an arcaded vestibule allowing the quadrangle to be seen from the street as Nuffield wanted The flat roofs were replaced with pitched roofs with ends and The staircase leading to the hall was removed and the hall repositioned on ground level without aisles but with a of oak trusses The tower which would now contain the common room was moved from the area of the former hall staircase to the east end of the chapel When the plans were shown to Nuffield in early 1940 the only change that he requested before giving his approval was for a more conventional tower to replace the spire on Harrison s design The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21 April 1949 when the foundation stone was laid work on the warden s residence had begun in October 1948 Before the buildings were erected the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford on and There were further changes to Harrison s second design as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield s original donation but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post war economic situation A scale model created in 1949 as work started showed the alterations a shortened tower a plainer main entrance and no arcades within the quadrangles Further changes were made once work was under way including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library instead of being purely ornamental windows were added at regular intervals and it was topped by a copper or small spire A further delay in construction was announced in 1951 when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive Work to complete the quadrangle including a hall kitchen and the library tower began in 1955 at a cost of 200 000 This money was donated to the college by the upon Lord Nuffield s recommendation Until it was required for books the of the college used the upper floor as a The tower was completed in 1956 and the college as a whole without the institute on the site opposite which is now used as a car park was finished in 1960 Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by in 1958 thereby becoming a self governing entity The charter was presented to the college by the on 6 June 1958 at the first lunch to be served in the hall Colvin commented that apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan the college as finally built contained none of the elements that had given Harrison s first design interest and distinction The remaining vestiges of the first plan he said were the two main axes within the college although no longer focussed on major architectural incidents and the masonry around the main doors cut to resemble the buildings of medieval Italy rather than those of Tudor England The college presents a symmetrical front to New Road and the castle mound with four small gables between a larger gable at either end There are two with steps leading down from the upper quadrangle to the east to the lower quadrangle to the west Residential accommodation for students and fellows is located in the lower quadrangle whilst the hall library and administrative offices are in the upper quadrangle The buildings are two storeys high with above There are pools in the centre of the quadrangles the one in the lower quadrangle is the longer of the two the writer said that these are almost puddles and saw them as relics of Harrison s Mediterranean plan The writer Peter Sager however thought that the pond represents the canal basin that previously occupied the site The main entrance leads into the upper quadrangle which has the hall on its east side The square windows facing the quadrangles are arranged in close set groups of three at the east end of the upper quadrangle the common room has a larger bay window An abstract sculpture by from 1962 has been positioned on the lawn inside the college Dalwood also designed the fountain in the pool in the upper quadrangle although his plan for a spray of water was not implemented leaving the sculpture with no obvious purpose The hall has a floor of black and white marble and arches made of concrete supporting an oak roof with red panels The furniture in the hall was designed by and the chairs were built by Lord Nuffield s are displayed over the fireplace carved from a single piece of stone and his portrait painted by hangs in the hall The chapel on the south side of the college can seat forty people It has five abstract windows that were designed by and executed by and a metal with a bronze crucifix The roofs are finished with from Many other Oxford colleges are roofed with from a quarry 10 miles 16 km northwest of Oxford but these were no longer available when Nuffield was built The main building stone used is stone The tower which has nine floors is about 90 feet 27 m tall with the flèche taking the total height to about 150 feet 46 m It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years Work was carried out in the library in 1999 to extend the total shelf length to just under 6 kilometres 3 7 mi The library contains paintings of Spring and Winter by and Summer and Autumn by The architectural writer Geoffrey Tyack has written that Nuffield College was Oxford s most important architectural project of the immediate post war years Opinions about the architecture merits of the college have varied although most have been unfavourable The authors of a 1961 booklet on the architecture of modern Oxford said that it was Oxford s biggest monument to barren reaction The Cotswold style was taken absurdly out of context and mercilessly stretched and did not harmonise with the clumsy tower whilst the spire perched uneasily despite its elaborate base An unnamed journalist wrote in in 1959 that the main buildings of the quadrangles were somewhat oddly wedded to small basins which irresistibly suggest a Lilliputian Versailles The same writer said that the tower rose Manhattan wise for 10 storeys through the twentieth century only to have a diminutive spire escaped from the fifteenth push through its top to steal the last laugh Peter Sager too thought that the high rise library could easily stand on the Hudson Sir Howard Colvin said that the utilitarian function of the tower accorded ill with its original ornamental purpose and that the architects had failed to find a satisfactory solution to the repetitive uniformity of fenestration Of the flèche Colvin said that it makes its contribution to the Oxford skyline without any overt reference to historical precedent Geoffrey Tyack also disliked the tower describing it as an ungainly structure that was lit by a monotonous array of windows punched out of the wall surface however he thought the hall was an effective reinterpretation of the traditional collegiate pattern The architectural historian compared the college unfavourably to the designs of the Danish architect for construction of which began in 1960 the year that Nuffield College was completed St Catherine s in his view was the most perfect piece of architecture of 20th century Oxford and made Nuffield look even more absurd Nevertheless he proposed forgiveness for the mighty tower which positively helps the famous skyline of Oxford adding that it has enough identity to be sure that one day it will find affection He said that the tower had something of the architect felicitous manipulation of period details into a non period whole and will I prophesy one day be loved although he was less sure that this fate awaited the rest of the buildings Simon Jenkins said of Pevsner s prophecy about the tower I doubt it he described it as at best ungainly with a weak spire and said that vegetation was its best hope as for the rest of Nuffield The college in his view required a sense of humour Writing in 1952 after the first section of the buildings was complete the editor of the said that Nuffield was a large scale example of period style architecture which has no justification whatever on grounds of consideration for the neighbours and represents missed opportunity of a really tragic kind As the site was away from the ancient colleges of the city centre and in an area of undistinguished nineteenth century commercial building there had been a rare opportunity of building something belonging to the twentieth century and of showing that Oxford does not live only in the past He said that the compromise between contemporary needs and what is imagined to be the English collegiate tradition is quite unworthy of the educational enterprise the new foundation represents He was however thankful that the building used smooth faced stone in the proper Oxford style rather than rubble facing which he said had been used elsewhere in Oxford with extraordinarily unpleasing results The architectural correspondent of wrote that the architecture of the college was incongruous it was remarkable that a college with connections to modern industry should be looking backwards in this way That a college devoted to modern scientific studies should be dressed up in the style of an antique Cotswold manor house has already been the subject of puzzled comment by many foreign visitors to Oxford Writing in also disliked the college s design referring to the Cotswold dementia of the architecture and the college s pokey windows and grotesque sugarloaf tower The chapel was described by the travel writer as one of the sweetest little sanctuaries in Oxford very simple almost stern with a contrast between the black and white pews and the rich colour of the stained glass However she said that whilst Oxford colleges change in style over time as buildings are added or altered Nuffield was a hodge podge from the start with a faintly Levantine tower upon a Cotswold Gothic base The writer Miles Jebb considered the contrast between the hall s black and white floor and red panelled roof to be most effective He thought that the enclosed layout of the college was a principal attraction but wrote that the tower s palpably utilitarian function detracts from its aesthetic attraction even though it made the emphatic addition to the skyline of Oxford that Nuffield wanted A R Woolley author of an guide to the city and university was more positive He described the tower as an exciting breakaway from the conventional with its spire as a secular contribution to the sky line He said that the buildings make a picturesque group of gabled Cotswold roofs adding that t heir design is simple and depends for its effects upon its just proportions It is at once traditional and original In 1993 the college became a Grade II a designation given to buildings of national importance and special interest The kerbstones around the pool in the west quadrangle have been given separate Grade II listing as an integral part of the Nuffield College scheme Monetary values are inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British GDP This measures the social cost of construction or investment as a proportion of

 The main one of the of the are located in the centre of the city of England between and was founded in 1571 by upon the petition of a clergyman who was treasurer of Her foundation charter gave to the college the land and buildings of White Hall a university hall that had experienced a decline in student numbers Price added new buildings to those of White Hall and construction work continued after his death in 1574 The first of the college s which includes the hall chapel and principal s lodgings was completed between 1621 and 1630 Construction of the second quadrangle began in the 1630s but was interrupted by the and was not completed until about 1712 Further buildings were erected in a third quadrangle during the 20th century including science laboratories now closed a library for undergraduates and additional accommodation for students and In addition to the main site the college owns flats in east and north Oxford and a sports ground The chapel which was dedicated in 1621 and extended in 1636 was extensively altered in 1864 under the supervision of the architect The alterations have had their supporters and their critics one historian of the college principal from 1921 to 1925 described the work as ill considered The hall s original was hidden by a plaster ceiling in 1741 when rooms were installed in the roofspace The principal s lodgings the last part of the first quadrangle to be constructed contain wooden panelling from the early 17th century The Fellows Library in the second quadrangle dates from 1679 and contains 11 000 antiquarian books it was restored at a cost of 700 000 in 2007 A new about twice the size of its predecessor was completed in the third quadrangle in 2002 Further student and teaching rooms were added in Ship Street opposite the college in 2010 Eleven parts of the college are including all four sides of the first and second quadrangles Nine parts including the chapel hall and principal s lodgings have the highest Grade I designation given to buildings of exceptional interest Two other parts an external wall and an early 20th century addition in the third quadrangle have a Grade II designation given to buildings of national importance and special interest The architectural historian described the first quadrangle as small and pretty and said that the behind the chapel altar was heavily gorgeous he was however critical of the Old Members Building in the third quadrangle opened in 1971 describing it as a mannered and modish design The historian said that the first quadrangle had a curious charm while the second quadrangle had a strong feeling of unity owing to the somewhat relentless succession of ogival gables The poet said that the clear planning of the first and second quadrangles coupled with the relationship of their size to the heights of the buildings around them make what would be undistinguished buildings judged on their detail into something distinguished However he regarded the early 20th century additions in the third quadrangle as dull The college buildings on the main site are arranged in three the first quadrangle containing the oldest college buildings and the third quadrangle the newest The quadrangles are often referred to as First Quad Second Quad and Third Quad for short As is often the case in Oxford colleges the rooms in the older buildings are connected to the quadrangles by a series of staircases rather than horizontally to each other by internal corridors The staircases are numbered sometimes using staircases 1 to 5 are in the first quadrangle staircases 6 to 13 in the second quadrangle and staircases 14 to 21 in the third quadrangle The stairs on staircase 3 were replaced with stone steps in 1878 setting what one historian of the college a of the college from 1939 to 1971 termed an unfortunate precedent since the ugly pattern of staircase 3 was adopted when repairs were carried out to staircase 13 after a fire in 1882 The foundation charter of the college issued by on 27 June 1571 upon the petition of treasurer of gave to the college a site located between the present day to the south and to the north this remains part of the college s site The charter also gave the buildings of White Hall one of a number of university halls in this location Halls provided lodgings and meals for students at the university and sometimes lectures and tuition as well As the system of colleges grew however halls declined in popularity and their sites and buildings tended to be taken over by colleges White Hall itself had previously belonged to and dated back to the 13th century it was described as a large tenement with a great stone gate and was sometimes known as Great White Hall Over time it seems to have absorbed neighbouring halls including Little White Hall on Ship Street from about 1450 which was at one time owned by By 1571 however White Hall was either completely or virtually deserted by students making it possible for Price to secure the site for the new college The college paid a for the land upon which White Hall stood to which had acquired the assets of St Frideswide s Priory This was initially 26 and 8 but it had been reduced to 8 pence before 1631 it was paid until 1866 when the charge was redeemed The land was described in Christ Church s records as extending from the Street to the Walnut tree in breadth from the Bowling Alley to the mud wall although no measurements were given The college also acquired the sites of other former halls in the vicinity including Laurence Hall previously owned by The last principal of White Hall James Charnock had taken a lease on Laurence Hall but was unable to attract sufficient students to satisfy Lincoln College and so he transferred the lease to who was principal of Jesus College from 1572 until his death in 1586 Lloyd bequeathed the lease to the college in his will Part of the college chapel was later erected on the site which measured 32 by 30 yards 29 by 27 m The first is smaller than the later second quadrangle measuring 93 feet 6 inches by 77 feet 28 50 by 23 m The buildings that now surround the first quadrangle were erected in stages between 1571 and the 1620s the principal s lodgings were the last to be built Progress was slow because the new college lacked the generous endowments that earlier colleges enjoyed Before new buildings were completed the students lived in the old buildings of White Hall Between 1571 and his death in 1574 Price spent about 1 500 on the construction of buildings that were two storeys high These ran from on the east of the site south towards the corner of Cheyney Lane as Market Street was then known and then west along Cheyney Lane to the buildings of the old Great White Hall Land at the corner of Turl Street and Cheyney Lane was leased and built upon and then purchased in 1580 There is a college tradition recorded in the college s first book of benefactors in the 17th century that Elizabeth I gave all kind of timber from and for buildings erected by Price Until the later building works of and principals from 1613 to 1620 and 1621 to 1630 respectively the college site consisted of a number of smallish mainly detached buildings with nothing resembling a formal garden layout in between s 1578 map of Oxford shows the extent of the buildings at that time Laurence Hall is the isolated group of buildings on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street There is then a gap along Turl Street before a building positioned south of the current entrance with glazed windows facing Turl Street and a large window or loft door at its north end another building then runs to the old White Hall buildings The Turl Street entrance appears from Agas s map to date from after Price s death and the north side of the building on Turl Street may have been integrated into an extension early in the 17th century although the date of such work is unclear Price is nevertheless sometimes given the credit for the archway on the inside of the entrance on the first quadrangle Overall whilst the structure of the buildings erected by Price remains only a little of his work can be seen from the outside after various alterations in the intervening centuries nevertheless his buildings have been said to retain much of their original character Some land in Ship Street to the west of the college was leased from in 1590 and further construction work took place after Powell was appointed principal in 1613 Powell raised money from donors in Oxford London and Wales collecting 838 12 2 in what has been described as an elaborate fundraising scheme with efforts to attract donations from old members of the college Ann Lloyd the widow of principal from 1572 to 1586 gave 100 the gave 66 13s 4d out of the total from Welsh clergy of 78 7s 4d The old Great White Hall buildings were demolished around 1620 and replaced and a kitchen and were constructed Work also started on building the hall and the chapel under Powell both were completed after his death in 1620 who became principal in 1621 raised 465 15s 6d from donors including the and the This was used for the perfecting of the Quadrangle of the building and furnishing of the library The college then had a complete quadrangle of buildings save for a gap between the chapel and the hall that would later be filled by the principal s lodgings built by Thelwall at his own expense the library later demolished was outside the quadrangle to the west of the north end of the lodgings The walls of the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone The remaining parts of the 17th century walls are dressed with which was a common building material in Oxford at that time the geologist wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist Areas of Headington stone can be seen in the first quadrangle on the wall of the hall It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well the surface of the stone develops a hard crust which blisters bursts and comes off Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result Further work was carried out to the east side of the college fronting onto Turl Street in 1756 under principal from 1727 to 1763 A new doorway replaced the previous Elizabethan one and the front of the college was remodelled in the style oblong were inserted at all levels and the original on the Turl Street side of the building were removed Pardo himself gave 157 10s towards this work although this only met the mason s bill of 156 18s 11d and not the other large bills for the work In the opinion of a college fellow who wrote a history of the college in 1899 and who served as principal from 1921 to 1925 this complete transformation gave the college a somewhat incongruous appearance The result was also said to resemble a prison One writer at the time however thought that the changes had not gone far enough the wrote a letter about architecture in Oxford to in 1766 He included Pardo s alterations to Jesus College in his list of improvements but advocated replacing the chapel window with one in principal from 1768 to 1802 gave 200 in total in 1791 and 1792 for repairs in the first quadrangle part of a general pattern of expenditure upon repair of the older college buildings in the 18th century In 1815 the original gables in the first quadrangle were removed and replaced with a third storey and matching the lodgings where battlements had been erected between 1733 and 1740 The height of the chapel wall was increased and many of the windows were altered The college received advice from the architect about this work he requested that instead of paying him the college should commission a portrait of him from to hang in the hall Lawrence depicted Nash in his house in London the portrait has been described by Lawrence s biographer the art historian as pungently vivid In 1853 under the direction of architect to the college from 1852 to 1882 the south front of the buildings was restored the exterior of the buildings on Turl Street was re faced in in 1856 with the tower over the gateway being built at the same time The total cost of this work was 3 349 Pardo s changes from the 18th century were removed in 1856 complimented Buckler on resisting the stream and following the style of the 15th century Peter Howell a writer on Victorian architecture referred to Buckler s work as providing Jesus with an attractive new front which represents the of an Oxford college The poet said that the front of the college opposite was a good specimen of work In contrast the architectural historian Geoffrey Tyack noted that the refacing came not long after the two other colleges in Turl Street Exeter and had been refaced and commented that Buckler s work in style completed a process whereby the façades of the colleges in Turl Street acquired a somewhat lifeless homogeneity which they had never possessed in the past W J Arkell wrote that some of the worst horrors of the Gothic revival cluster on either side of Turl Street When writing a history of the college in 1891 the vice principal said that the work was admitted to be very well done but that there were those who thought that the old Jacobean gateway was more in harmony with the domestic architecture of the College and more suitable to its position in a narrow street The stonework on the front of the college was last cleaned in 2000 when the by the Turl Street entrance was also rebuilt to provide better office accommodation for the for students and greater security Four grass plots were added to the centre of the quadrangle in 1896 crossed by paths before that it had been since 1662 The architectural historian described the first quadrangle as small and pretty especially because of the variety of its ranges He noted the part and part on the south side where Price s building stops the join between the two he pointed out is easily visible in Market Street The windows in the first quadrangle he noted were Elizabethan in style with windows and arched lights arranged symmetrically whereas the hall windows were in style The historian wrote that the first quadrangle had a curious charm due partly to its size and partly due to its several small eccentricities including the curved path crossing the quadrangle from the entrance to the hall The architect and designer though thought that the crooked off axis line of the path was the college s oddest feature All four sides of the first quadrangle are the highest grade for buildings of exceptional importance and international interest the lodgings and chapel on the north side the hall on the west side and the buildings on the east and south sides Construction of the chapel began when Griffith Powell was Principal 1613 1620 It was finished under Sir Eubule Thelwall who took office in 1621 with the leading the dedication ceremony on 28 May 1621 Thelwall s portrait displayed in the hall shows him holding a roll inscribed A plan of the Chappell in Jesus Coll Oxford built by Sir Eubule Thelwall reflecting the fact that he was the main donor towards the chapel s construction There are four windows facing the quadrangle in the style Seats were added in 1633 and it was extended in two directions in 1636 The east end was moved to reach Turl Street a new east window was added and the previous window was converted into an arch at the other end the entrance was moved further to the west Sir Charles Williams of south Wales paid 200 towards the final bill of 211 The architectural historian has described the chapel s east window as an instance of architecture rather than Gothic Survival since a choice was made to use an outdated style had become accepted as the only style in which it was respectable to build The window has seven main sections lights topped with five headed flower shapes or and running vertically The chapel is one of various buildings at the universities of Oxford and from the first half of the 17th century where Gothic designs were deliberately chosen in preference to Classical other examples are the chapel of the chapel windows and hall roof at and the library of where the library of 1624 was built with Gothic windows since some men of judgement preferred the old fashion as it was most meet for such a building Similarly the artist and art historian Aymer Vallance writing in 1908 said that Gothic architecture though ailing and doomed lingered longest at Oxford University adding that the chapel windows of Jesus and Wadham were almost as astonishing for their period as the magnificent 1640 entrance to the hall of built nearly three hundred years after fan vaulting had been used in the cloisters of The only examples of classical style in Oxford before the Civil War were s Canterbury Quad at and a few gateways such as those at the by Cambridge had even less The chapel has not been universally appreciated however the and archivist wrote in 1821 that excepting that it was built by private contributions from the gentry of Wales it would be cruel The measures 16 feet 6 inches by 22 feet 9 inches 5 03 by 6 93 m and the main body of the chapel measures 52 feet 6 inches by 22 feet 16 by 6 7 m A London merchant Lewis Roberts gave some hundreds of white and black marble stones towards ye paving of the upper part of the chapel according to in his inventory of 1648 It is unclear when these were added to the floor some are still in position although others were removed in the 1864 renovation The oak dates from the early 17th century and has moulded rectangular panels There is a bell turret on the west end of the roof which has shaped openings on the west and east sides and panels decorated with trefoils on the other two sides It was built in about 1915 replacing an earlier turret of similar shape The porch at the chapel entrance was moved to its present position when the chapel was extended in 1636 The are moulded as are the tops of the columns The arch is divided into segments with a rose in the left and a thistle in the right spandrel The use of the rose and thistle national emblems of England and Scotland respectively in this way dates the porch to the reign of who used these flowers as his badge after his accession to the English throne in 1603 Moulded brackets support the within which the contains palms and cherub heads in the The Latin inscription above the archway is Let prayers ascend and grace descend The original entrance was covered up when the chapel was extended it was only re discovered when the chapel was refaced in Bath stone in 1869 principal from 1686 to 1712 is reported to have spent 1 000 during his lifetime on the interior of the chapel particularly in the chancel at the east end but also including the addition of a screen separating the main part of the chapel from the at the west end in 1693 The screen bears the of principal 1661 1673 and until 1899 also bore Thelwall s coat of arms His arms were moved to a position above the door where says one writer they can scarcely be seen when an organ by was installed in the ante chapel in 1899 The current organ by was installed in 1994 to replace the Binns organ The screen has open ovals rather than blank ovals an example said Pevsner of the importance given to openwork carving in the later 17th century After the installation of the screen little changed in the chapel until the middle of the 19th century save for some donations of items such as a brass desk and two silver candlesticks In 1853 principal 1817 1857 the fellows of the college and the incumbents of most of the within its gift donated 350 10s for by to be added to the east window the final cost was 399 It shows various biblical episodes including three instances of Christ raising people from the dead the and There are also pairs of scenes from the New Testament and the Old Testament to demonstrate the between them for example the is paired with the escaping from the whale with the and the ascension of with the Pevsner described it as a busy somewhat gloomy piece with many small scenes A copy of s painting which had been presented to the college by a student who at the university in 1769 had previously been hung in front of the east window When the stained glass was installed the painting was moved to the ante chapel it was moved to the south wall of the chancel when the Binns organ was installed The panels of Hedgeland s window were removed and cleaned in the summer of 2000 while maintenance was being carried out to the Turl Street stonework On 15 June 1863 the principal principal 1857 1877 and fellows agreed to renovate the chapel One of the prime movers behind the decision was the vice principal as part of his unsuccessful attempt to move the college towards The architect was appointed and had almost free rein in his work In 1863 he said to the that the chapel was so good in style considering its late date that it would be very inadvisable to alter it in any respect save one the old features of the walls and roofing However he later said that the fittings were incongruous with the seats being so thoroughly uncomfortable that kneeling is rendered all but impossible and sitting even is concerted into a sort of penance His work was completed in 1864 at a cost of 1 679 18s 10d The arch of the chancel was widened and the memorials to Sir Eubule Thelwell and Francis Mansell which had been on each side of the arch were moved to the north wall of the chancel The original Jacobean woodwork was removed with the exception of the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit new seats were installed and new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel A stone was added behind the altar although the design originally submitted by Street was not approved and he was asked to make changes The reredos as finally installed has three marble panels a centre Christ carrying his cross right and Christ on the knees of St Mary left The altar has a slab and six pillars all made from Views of Street s alterations have differed On 21 October 1864 reported that the restoration was nearing completion and was of a very spirited character It said that the new handsome arch showed the east window to great advantage with other improvements including a handsome reredos and an exceedingly beautiful pavement of marble alabaster and Llewellyn Thomas said that there might be two opinions as to the success of the restoration but there was no doubt that widening the arch was a mistake since it has permanently dwarfed the proportions of the building He said that the new woodwork though good of its kind presented too violent a contrast with the ante chapel screen Hardy was also critical calling the work ill considered He complained that the Jacobean woodwork had been sold for too little saying that it had been ruthlessly torn up and sold for a mere song to a passing stranger and described the reredos as somewhat tawdry William Stride writing at about the same time as Hardy said that the beautiful Jacobean interior of the chapel had been destroyed and Oxford had narrowly escaped other irreparable losses Norwich said that the restoration was good in individual details but was sadly damaging to its character and atmosphere In contrast Pevsner called the reredos heavily gorgeous One chaplain in the 20th century covered up the reredos with curtains describing the brown and white marbling as looking like corned beef Betjeman however was heard when showing a group around the college to describe the altar as delicious he also wrote that the chapel s fine classic screen had somehow survived a fearful restoration The curtains around the altar and a carpet covering the tiling in the aisle were removed when the new organ was installed in 1994 following the organ builder s advice that these items detracted from the chapel acoustics The work proved to be Street s only commission at the university although he built or restored a number of churches in the city In his biography of his father Arthur Street said that it was possible that George Street s very decided adherence to the earlier phase of Gothic and the eagerness with which he argued that Oxford had already enough of debased types and should revert to the purity of the early forms may have frightened the authorities Casson although referring to the chapel and other parts of the college from the Victorian era as mostly pretty dull thought that the sturdy pews with their flatly modelled leafy finials hold their own The woodwork removed by Street was sold for a nominal sum with a condition that it could only be used for a hall chapel or library Some pieces ended up in the library and chapel of in east London an institution that previously had no link to the college Panels under the were also removed from the chapel even though Street had reported to the college that these carvings were the only portion of the chapel woodwork with any real value and had suggested at one point reusing them in connection with the ante chapel screen and the adjoining seats Some of the woodwork was transferred to in Anglesey which had links with the college from 1648 until the was disestablished in 1920 Some of the panels may also have been re used in the Fellows Library in the second quadrangle other panelling at Bodedern came from the college but not apparently from the chapel and so may have been from a disused library gallery The chapel contains monuments to several former principals In addition to those of Sir Eubule Thelwell and Francis Mansell relocated to the north wall of the chancel there are monuments to Sir Leoline Jenkins who is buried in the chapel Jonathan Edwards Thomas Pardo Charles Williams and Thelwall s monument is one of the few in Oxford to include kneeling figures There are painted glass windows in memory of Llewellyn Thomas by of Charles Williams by of Samuel Morris a victim of the sinking of in 1878 by and of Lewis Gilbertson The of who studied at the college in the 1930s and was twice hangs on the south wall it was donated by his widow after his death in 1995 Formerly displayed in the chapel was a bust of better known as Lawrence of Arabia by the sculptor which is a copy of the one in Lawrence was a student at the college graduating in 1910 The principal of the college resides in the lodgings a Grade I listed building on the north side of the first quadrangle between the chapel to the east and the hall to the west They were the last part of the first quadrangle to be built Sir Eubule Thelwall principal from 1621 to 1630 built the lodgings at his own expense to include in the words of the antiquarian a very fair dining room adorned with wainscot curiously engraven Tyack said that the carved wooden panelling of the main rooms set a new standard of luxury for the heads of colleges Pevsner commented that the panelling set in three tiers with ovals placed vertically rather than horizontally looks both dignified and splendid In 1637 the lodgings were considerably changed with the installation of five studyes The over the doorway which Pevsner and Casson both called beautiful was added at some point between 1670 and 1740 Pevsner dates it to about 1700 It is elaborately carved on the inside with a decorated and a cherub head Casson called it the college s most engaging feature The original gables over the front of the lodgings were removed and replaced with battlements between 1733 and 1740 drew up plans to alter the lodgings in 1802 His plans were not used immediately although other work was carried out at that time but they were partly implemented in 1884 when a north wing was added using stone This extension was later converted into general college accommodation An on the west side of the lodgings overlooking the second quadrangle was also added in 1884 Much of the lodgings were refaced between 1927 and 1935 using stone on the side facing the front quadrangle in place of the original Headington stone In 1654 when was principal the college accounts record payment for construction of a ball court This was to the west of the principal s garden which is to the north of the lodgings alongside Ship Street between a stables and the wall of the garden Ball courts bowling greens and were often added within the precincts of colleges during the 17th century so that undergraduates could amuse themselves under the watchful eyes of their tutors rather than indulge in forbidden pursuits such as drinking in alehouses In 1757 principal Thomas Pardo added the area of the ball court to the garden of the lodgings and had a coach house built there which was reached from an entrance on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street along a driveway across the north of the garden The garden and the ball court are depicted in s 1675 engraving of the college which shows an attractive pleasure garden with box edged paths and dense patterns of formal beds In 1826 the garden was renovated and a Bath stone gateway installed on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street The size of the garden has been reduced at the west end by the 1884 extension to the lodgings which was built on the area of the old ball court and at the east end by the construction of a bicycle shed and garage The boundary wall that runs from the north of the chapel along Turl Street and along Ship Street to the north of the garden is a Grade II listed building a designation given to buildings of national importance and special interest The hall like the chapel was largely built by Griffith Powell between 1613 and 1620 and was finally completed soon after his death in 1620 The panelling three tables and two benches date from Powell s time It measures 54 by 25 feet 16 5 by 7 6 m and is a Grade I listed building The fireplace was set in an enclosed hearth with a large projecting in contrast to the traditional method of heating the hall which was by a brazier on an open hearth A screen was installed in 1634 at a cost of 3 1s Pevsner noted the screen s elaborately decorated columns and the dragons along the frieze and said that it was one of the earliest examples in Oxford of panelling using four L shapes around a centre Norwich said that the dragons on the screen were rather lovable and Tyack said that they underlined the Welsh connections of the college the is one of the national symbols of Wales The stone steps from the first quadrangle to the hall were added in 1637 During the 17th century changes were made to the interior of the hall Windows painted with various coats of arms were removed and a was added on the west side Pevsner commented that the hall windows themselves are different from all other 17th century Gothic windows in Oxford except for the exactly contemporary hall bay window of Exeter In 1741 and 1742 a total of 423 17s 4d was spent on the hall which included the cost of covering the oak beamed roof with plaster and making rooms in the original roof space Writing in 1891 Llewellyn Thomas noted that the plaster roof was added to create attic rooms to increase the accommodation of the lodgings He expressed the hope that the hall might soon regain its original proportions following the enlargement of the lodgings a few years previously This has not happened and the plaster ceiling remains However in 2003 partitions between the rooms were knocked through to convert them into teaching rooms and the renovations enabled the upper part of the hall s to be seen from inside the rooms Pevsner described the 1741 on the north wall which contains the college crest as large and rich Tyack noted the lively plasterwork of the flat ceiling In the early 19th century the east and west sides of the hall were and the roof was re slated A clock was installed on the external wall of the hall in 1831 by the principal There is a college tradition that students aim a champagne cork at the clock after finishing their final university examinations hitting it is supposed to mean that the student will obtain a An extensive fire on 4 December 1913 threatened to destroy the hall before it was brought under control In the rebuilding work that followed a gallery was added to the hall with the balustrade joining the 1634 screen The hall contains a portrait of Elizabeth I as well as portraits of former principals and benefactors There are also portraits by court artists of two other monarchs who were college benefactors by and by It has been said to be among the most impressive of all the Oxford college halls with its fine panelling austere ceiling and its notable paintings Francis Mansell who was appointed principal in 1630 raised hundreds of pounds from donors towards the building of a second quadrangle in 1640 Buildings along part of the north and south sides were completed at this time and in 1638 he purchased some land known as Coggan s Garden adjoining Market Street for 90 upon which much of the west side of the second quadrangle was later built The college also unsuccessfully proposed to the city council in 1638 that it should be permitted to expand to the north by closing Ship Street and purchasing the council s properties there According to his successor and biographer Sir Leoline Jenkins Mansell had sufficient benefactors to be able to complete the quadrangle including the construction of a library on the west side but the outbreak of the in 1641 put paid to his plans Welsh tenants who supported refused to pay rent to the college after was installed as principal in 1648 by the puritan regime leaving the college on the verge of financial collapse Overall the college was reduced to administrative chaos and in 1660 it was said to be in a shatter d condition having suffered a decade of corruption and internal strife quite unique in Oxford during the revolutionary period The college obtained further land on Market Street in 1675 and building work began again in 1676 Sir Leoline Jenkins built the library on the west side which was completed by 1679 After further land was obtained to link the Market Street and Ship Street sides of the college further rooms including what is now known as the SCR were built at the instigation of Jonathan Edwards principal from 1688 to 1712 to complete the inner quadrangle the project was completed just after his death in 1712 Work to add a ceiling and in the SCR took place in 1736 at a cost of 52 4 5 with the walls to the west of the college placed further back to enlarge the common room s garden and increase the light Some minor work to repair and restore the walls has been carried out using The second quadrangle is larger than the first quadrangle measuring 103 feet 6 inches by 94 feet 6 inches 31 55 by 28 80 m The central plot of the quadrangle was filled with gravel from at least 1695 grass was laid in 1859 All four sides of the quadrangle are Grade I listed buildings Pevsner described the second quadrangle as a uniform composition noting the regular fenestration by windows with round arched lights their hood moulds forming a continuous frieze The have sides and semi circular Norwich described the second quadrangle as having a strong feeling of unity owing to the somewhat relentless succession of ogival gables adding that One is grateful for the projecting bay oriel chimneybreast and clock on the east side for breaking the monotony He pointed out that it was almost a carbon copy of the front quadrangle of which was begun in 1634 in describing University College he wrote that There are the same two light windows the same continuous rising and falling head moulds on the three storeys even the same oddly shaped gables as in Jesus College Tyack too said that the gables were clearly influenced by University College The writer said that the quadrangle has the familiar Oxford Tudor windows and decorative Dutch gables crowding the skyline like Welsh dragons teeth and lightened by exuberant flower boxes Betjeman describing the first and second quadrangles said that they had what look like Cotswold manors on all sides adding that The clearness of the planning of Jesus College and the relation of the heights of the buildings to the size of the quadrangles make what would be undistinguished buildings judged on their detail into something distinguished The 19th century antiquarian Rowley Lascelles however described the ogee gables as dismal and called for them to be cut down into battlements crenellations to match those on the hall bay window he went further saying that this whole College requires to be as it is called that is into the pointed style It is a good subject for it Casson said that the second quadrangle was much the same mixture as the first but looked a bit cramped and stiff What is now called the Fellows Library on the west side of the second quadrangle dates from 1679 it was built by Sir Leoline Jenkins appointed principal in 1661 one of the project s donors It replaced the college s first purpose built library built by Sir Eubule Thelwall to the west of the hall in line with the lodgings on the north side of what is now the college s second quadrangle Until that time the books had been kept in rooms above the kitchen and buttery Thelwall s library appears to have been built over a covered walkway with rooms for students above it It fell into a ruinous condition and was pulled down by 1640 when Francis Mansell principal since 1630 erected further buildings on the north and south sides of the quadrangle After a long delay in building work caused by the effects of the civil war the college purchased three properties on Market Street adjoining Coggan s Garden in 1675 and development of the south west corner of the second quadrangle took place between 1676 and 1678 at a cost of 1 439 14s 13d The library which is 65 feet 20 m long and 21 feet 9 inches 6 63 m wide was built on the first floor of a free standing building above common rooms for students and fellows and largely followed the layout of Thelwall s earlier library The books were moved to their new location in 1679 The library contains bookcases dating from about 1628 which are decorated with and were used in the earlier library The bookcases are 7 feet 2 1 m long with hinged desks Some of the books were these were removed at an unknown date although some payments for chains were made until 1765 A gallery storey was added probably in 1691 and a wood panelled gallery runs the length of the east side It is reached by an ingenious and graceful spiral staircase On the west side of the library there are nine windows on two levels on the east side there are now six on the lower level and four blocked by gallery bookcases on the upper level The layout of the library as well as the position of an exposed timber suggests that there was previously a gallery on the west side If so it was not used after 1800 when the library was re arranged It may have been removed and transferred to along with some woodwork from the chapel after Street s renovations with other sections of the chapel woodwork re used in the east gallery some of the carved patterns in the gallery are identical to those in Bodedern and some of the gallery panels have been cut to fit their position or are loose fitting or upside down suggestive of repositioning from a previous location Hardy s opinion was that if only it had an open timber roof instead of the plain ceiling it would be one of the most picturesque College Libraries Another author said in 1914 after the provision of a library for undergraduates elsewhere in the quadrangle that it was one of the most charming of Oxford libraries and one of the least frequented The window at the south end has four lights Pevsner noted that it was Gothic in style despite the date of construction Simon Jenkins said that the library is a delight Betjeman wrote in 1938 that The woodwork the brown leather of the books the clear windows and the slim height of the room make it one of the best little known sights of Oxford The library holds 11 000 antiquarian printed books and houses many of the college s rare texts including a Greek bible dating from 1545 and signed by and others much of the library of the scholar and philosopher and 17th century volumes by and The library also holds the undergraduate thesis of T E Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia entitled The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture to the end of XIIth Century The college launched a restoration appeal in 2007 for work that was anticipated to cost 700 000 The roof was leaking the floorboards had been affected by and and new heating and ultra violet light controls were needed to help preserve the books The work to remedy these problems and others was completed in 2008 The long but narrow third quadrangle adjoins Ship Street on the north of the site and to the west of the garden of the principal s lodgings where the college has owned some land since its foundation In the 18th century this was home to the college stables A fire in 1904 led to the demolition of the stables and the gateway to Ship Street The fire also caused considerable damage to another building about 80 metres 260 ft long owned by the college The ground floor had been rented out to the Oxford Electric Light Company the fire originated in their premises when cables overheated and the first floor had been used as a carpenter s shop and a bookseller s stores This building was also demolished along with houses occupied by the college porter and the college butler Some stones from the demolished building were used to build a house in Replacement buildings adjoining Ship Street effectively creating a third quadrangle for the college were constructed between 1906 and 1908 These were designed by the college architect and surveyor Reuben England and built in Doulting stone with stone dressings experience having shown that Doulting stone lasts longer when used in combination with a harder stone The buildings which have been given a Grade II listing have been said to be keeping with the medieval look of the college as refaced by Buckler in the 19th century However Howell s description of England s work on Ship Street is that the design was in an almost comically traditional style and Betjeman thought that the buildings were dull Casson described the third quadrangle as a long narrow court with a jumble of nineteenth and twentieth century buildings trying a bit too hard to be interesting The extension cost 13 656 It contained the college s science laboratories and a new gate tower as well as further living accommodation and a library for students known as the Library after a major donor there had been an undergraduate library in the second quadrangle since 1865 known as the Meyricke Library from 1882 onwards A small block of toilets and bathrooms was also built in the third quadrangle in 1908 it was nicknamed the fourth quad Until then students had had to use tin baths in their rooms to wash It was not until 1946 that the college began to install baths and wash basins on each staircase in the quadrangles The fourth quad was demolished as part of the work to erect the Old Members Building in 1971 The third quadrangle also contains the bar in the basement beneath the library the computer room and student laundry facilities The laboratories which were in use from 1907 to 1947 occupied three floors They were overseen for all but the last three years by the a college fellow from 1907 to 1944 At the time of their closure they were the last college based science laboratories at the university They were named the Sir Leoline Jenkins laboratories after the former principal of the college The laboratories led to scientific research and tuition particularly in chemistry becoming an important part of the college s academic life The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the who wished to continue their research at Oxford The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students they were closed in 1947 The college then converted the laboratories along with other rooms in the buildings adjoining Ship Street into further accommodation for students and fellows as well as relocating the Meyricke Library and providing a separate library for Celtic studies The total cost was 25 000 The Old Members Building which contains a music room 24 study bedrooms and some lecture rooms was built between 1969 and 1971 and designed by John Fryman of the Architects Design Partnership It was built after a fundraising appeal to to mark the college s quatercentenary and was opened by in 1971 When the plans for the building were being drawn up the college stated that it was prepared to sacrifice some accommodation to obtain a scheme of architectural merit The result is a concrete building faced with concrete and as elsewhere in the third quadrangle Clipsham limestone Part of the ground floor is an extension at the rear of on and so access is at first floor level The windows which project from the bedrooms in a V shape were said to have been intended to reflect the intricacy of the older building and to help improve the views from within Pevsner was critical of the use of in the design He wrote that the entrance was reached by staircases set diagonally which is typical of the building and that Fryman had succumbed to the canting fashion of today canted back canted exposed supports on the entrance floor canted base to the two upper floors He called it a mannered and modish design Tyack referred to the building s Norwich said that it displays an antipathy to the right angle that makes the Front Quad look positively Pythagorean Another reviewer though said that whilst the building tried too hard to be Oxford with quirky and derivative details the design made ingenious use of minimal space and filled a drab corner with something lively and intimate overall the review concluded the virtues of the building overcame its faults A conference room known as the Room after a former principal was added in 1989 The Old Members Building is connected by a bridge Pevsner adding Of course it runs diagonally to further college rooms above shops on Ship Street These were added in 1908 1909 and were also designed by England Pevsner noted the four symmetrically grouped gables There are also some student rooms above the shops in Cornmarket Street some of which were refurbished in 2000 In 2002 a two year project to rebuild the property above the shops on Ship Street was completed As part of the work carried out by the architects Maguire Co the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new JCR to replace the common room in the second quadrangle which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students The new JCR about twice the size of the previous one can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings there is also a kitchen a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms The two rooms of the old JCR each of which contain war memorials have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room The Fellows Garden runs behind the west side of the second quadrangle behind the SCR it can be reached from there or from the third quadrangle It dates from 1683 when 3s 6d was spent on making a garden it would have been about 100 feet 30 m long and between 10 to 20 feet 3 0 to 6 1 m wide but a further purchase of land in 1735 extended its length to about 170 feet 52 m It is now overshadowed by adjoining buildings including the Old Members Building Former college archivist Brigid Allen has described it as a kind of gated tunnel between high buildings paved scattered with seats and tables and filled with gloomy foliage of the purple leaved plum In 2019 work began on redevelopment of a commercial property Northgate House owned by the college on the corner of and Market Streets to provide new student accommodation above retail facilities with a new quad and other teaching facilities behind according to a masterplan by MICA Architects projected for completion to mark the college s 450th anniversary in 2021 The college purchased 10 acres 0 040 km 0 016 sq mi of land in east Oxford near the in 1903 for use as a sports ground The 1905 pavilion was replaced in 1998 by a new pavilion on the opposite side of the sports ground the old pavilion is now used as a table tennis room ground floor with a three bedroomed flat for graduates above Residential accommodation was first built at the sports ground in 1967 Thelwall House rebuilt in 1998 with additions between 1988 and 1990 Hugh Price House and Leoline Jenkins House Writing in 1974 Pevsner said that Thelwall House was one of the recent college buildings that deserved note A further development known as Hazel Court after principal 1925 1944 was built in 2000 bringing the total number of students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135 Writing in the Journal in 2002 Jeremy Melvin praised the architects of Hazel Court Maguire Co for their crispness of detail and richness of composition he said that the sense of ordered space recalls the way in which the traditional collegiate quads gave architectural expression to the then new idea of a university He noted that whilst the first impression of the houses was Elizabethan with the air of a courtyard garden closer inspection reveals a contemporary design sensibility there was he wrote the impression of an order that comes from making the construction explicit whils combining sensitivity to function and use However he commented that whilst there was plenty of space inside the furniture would not look out of place in a motorway hotel Donations from an Old Member of the college enabled the construction in 1974 of student flats at a site in north Oxford on the named Stevens Close in his honour The flats were opened by in 1976 The college also owns a number of houses on Ship Street which are used for student accommodation It has purchased a further site in Ship Street at a cost of 1 8M which will be converted at a projected cost of 5 5M to provide 31 student rooms with en suite facilities a 100 seat lecture theatre and other teaching rooms The site includes a from the Oxford city wall which is a The plans provide for the inner curve of the bastion to be used as a featured alcove in the ground floor reception area and for study bedrooms on the upper floors The Ship Street Centre was officially opened by the on 25 September 2010 Monetary values after 1830 are inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British GDP This measures the social cost of construction or investment as a proportion of the economy s total output of goods and services As GDP measures are not available prior to 1830 pre 1830 dates are inflated using changes in British predominantly southern English average wage labour earnings this measures the social cost of dedicating labour to a particular project Both of these measures allow a reader to consider the equivalent social impact in current terms how much would contemporary Britons need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy As of January 2017 the latest year for which contemporary figures are available is 2015
